## 4. Background of Cuban Salsa
Cuban Salsa (also called Casino) originated in Havana in the 1950s.  It borrowed moves from Cha Cha Cha, Mambo, Rumba, Jive, and Son and can be danced with single partner or with a circle of many dancers. Its popularity has expanded greatly in countries outside of Cuba.  It started with Miami, and eventualy spread all over the world.  The beauty of Cuban salsa is that you can jump in to a group of ten dancers, all from different countries, none of whom you know, and together, instantly create a beautiful, synchronized dance choreography.
