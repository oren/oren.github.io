# PPL - Strength and Bodybuilding Program

### What is it?

PPL is a 6 days program that with the goal of increasing both strength and muscle. PPL stands for push, pull, legs and It's a very popular program on r/fitness. You start with strength exercises (barbell work, pull-ups, etc) and finish with bodybuilding, for smaller muscles like biceps/triceps. It's suppose to be 6 days a week - pull, push, legs, rest, push, pull, legs but it's not a big deal if you do 5 days if you can't do 6 or even 7 days if you can. Just follow what your body tells you. The important thing is to hit enough sets per muscle groups in a given week. The original description is on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for).

General notes:
* The idea of this program is to start with big/compound exercises for strength and finish with smaller muscles, for bodybuilding/aesthetics. You can replace each exercise with something else if you can't do or just want some variety.
* Shoulders, back, and abs, can be worked on everyday. I personally have issue growing my shoulders so I added about 10 sets a week whenever I have the time.
* You can do super sets if you feel like (two exercises intertwined without rest).
