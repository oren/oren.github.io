# Freediving

## Safety Tips

* Adjust your weight belt so you float without moving
* One up one down - when your partner dive, you stay on the surface
* Watch your partner as they go down
* Stay 3 feet away from your partner when they come back so you can grab them if they blackout
* Watch your partner for 30 seconds after they came back
* Watch for your partner's lips color - blue lips might indicate lack of oxygen
* Don't hyperventilate

## What to do if your partner blackedout

* Hold them above the water in one hand, and keep his chin up in the other hand
* Turn them on their back
* Breath toward both eyes, Tap on thier cheek, and call their name. Repate until they wake up
