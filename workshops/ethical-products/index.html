<h1>Ethical products and how to build them</h1>

<p>Building products that makes you and others feel good about themselves is complex. It requires understanding of ethical frameworks, behavioural economics, game theory, system thinking, complexity science, and other deep topics. At the end of the workshop you will have a few documents that describes an experiment, a product that you can build with others.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t decide on the format of the workshop. It might be a 2 hours self-guided content or a game. Email orengolan@gmail.com to get notified when the workshop is available or to share feedback and ideas!</p>

<h2>Learning Outcomes:</h2>

<p>After completing the workshop you will be able to:
* Build your first experiment: a document that describes a product for a specific need and market.
* Be able to differentiate between a process and a mechanism.
* Understand what a mechanism is and build one.
* Build your first team - a document that describes a team (vision, challenge, operating principles, goals, structure, policies, mechanisms, resources).
* Identify incentive style for each of your direct reports.
* Identify and build team and mechanisms with signals that are aligned with the goals of the mechanism.</p>

<h2>Agenda:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Module 1: Ethical framework (document a framework)</li>
<li>Module 2: Product (document a product using Product market-fit pyramid)</li>
<li>Module 3: Process (document a process: tool and feedback loops)</li>
<li>Module 4: Team (document a team: vision, goal, operating principles, structure, polices, mechanisms, resources)</li>
<li>Module 5: Signals (document signals and ensure they are aligned with the team&rsquo;s goal)</li>
<li>Module 6: Sense-making (document rapid and collaborative innovation process using Cynefin and Wardley Mapping)</li>
</ol>
