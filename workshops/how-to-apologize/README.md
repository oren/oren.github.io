# How to apologize?

This is a 30 minutes self-guided workshop.

## The process
1. Admit.
2. Apologize.
3. Tell what you would do differently (repair).
4. Demonstrate doing the right action in a similar situation.

Note: this process is borrowed from Judaism. If you know a better process, let me know!

## Examples
I will complete this in a few days.

## Practice
Write down an apology and ask a friend or me (orengolan@gmail.com) for assessment.
