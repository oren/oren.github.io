# Apology Workshop

How to apologize and repair a relationship?

> "the purpose of mistakes is to help us to see ourselves."

This is a 30 minutes self-guided workshop. Email [orengolan@gmail.com](mailto:orengolan@gmail.com?Subject=Sharing%20feedback%20on%20the%20Apology%20Workshop&Body=Thank%20you%20❤️) if you find this useful or if you want to share your thoughts.

## The process
1. Admit.
2. Apologize.
3. Tell what you would do differently (repair).
4. Demonstrate doing the right action in a similar situation.

Note: this process is borrowed from Judaism. If you know a better process, let me know!

## Examples
I will complete this in a few days.

## Practice
Write down an apology and ask a friend or me ([orengolan@gmail.com](mailto:orengolan@gmail.com?Subject=Apology%20Workshop&Body=My%20Apology%20❤️)) for assessment.
