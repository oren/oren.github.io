# NVC Training for leaders

## 1. The challenge
Have you seen a conflict at work that caused significant harm to individuals or teams' morale? Have you seen passive aggressive behavior and tension between teams that go unaddressed for a while? What if you had a powerful tool that everyone in your organization can adopt in a few hours which helps resolve the root of conflicts to everyone's satisfaction?

## 2. Suggested solution
[Nonviolent Communication](https://oren.github.io/articles/nvc/) (NVC) is a process to build stronger relationships while resolving disagreements and conflicts. The idea is that everyone can be compassionate and empathetic. We use behavior that harms others only when we do not recognize more effective strategies for meeting our needs or the needs of others.

## 3. Learning Objectives of the session
At the end of the session, you will:
1. Understand what Nonviolent Communication (NVC).
1. Recognize what situations you can use NVC it for.
1. Recognize the 4 elements in NVC.
1. Be able to help co-workers resolve a conflicts by practicing NVC with them.
