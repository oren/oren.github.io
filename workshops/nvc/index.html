<p>Oren Golan: “I spent the last 15 years building, operating, and scaling product and engineering teams. My operating principles are empathy, inclusivity, transparency, and a sense of urgency. I gravitate toward challenges that are in the complex domain and require emergent, bottom-up strategies. I have worn engineering, product, sales, and business development hats at startups in Israel and the US. I worked at Amazon and AWS for 7 years, and currently, I work for a healthcare company that reduces at-home recovery time for patients and decreases the operating costs of care management for health insurance companies.”</p>
