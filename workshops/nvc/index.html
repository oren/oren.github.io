<h1>NVC Training for leaders</h1>

<h2>1. The challenge</h2>

<p>Have you seen a conflict at work that caused significant harm to individuals or teams&rsquo; morale? Have you seen passive aggressive behavior and tension between teams that go unaddressed for a while?

<h2>2. Suggested solution</h2>

<p><a href="https://oren.github.io/articles/nvc/">Nonviolent Communication</a> (NVC) is a process to build stronger relationships while resolving disagreements and conflicts. The idea is that everyone can be compassionate and empathetic.
