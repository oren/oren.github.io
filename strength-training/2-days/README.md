## High-Rep Optimization

While 10 reps is a great "anchor," the following muscles often respond better to 12–15 reps with slightly lighter weight. This is because they are smaller, have a shorter range of motion, or are prone to "cheating" with momentum when the weight is too heavy:

* Lateral Raises (Side Shoulders): These are notorious for being hard to do with heavy weight without swinging. Going lighter and doing more reps usually yields a better "pump" and wider shoulders.
* Leg Curls (Hamstrings): The hamstrings can be prone to cramping or strain with extremely heavy, low-rep isolation. 12–15 reps keeps the tension high and the joints safe.
* Ab Roller / Leg Raises (Abs): For core, quality of contraction is everything. If 10 reps feels like you’re just using your hip flexors, drop the intensity and aim for 15 slow, controlled reps.
* Tricep Pushdowns: Higher reps help flush the muscle with blood and avoid elbow tendonitis which can sometimes happen with heavy, low-rep extensions.
