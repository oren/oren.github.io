## Abstract

It's not the turing test, it's the Sopranos. Singularity will arrive when AI will be able to understand a dialog from The Sopranos.

Star Trek, The Matrix, Her, Ghost in the Shell - pick one. Will the future of AI be like any of those movies? Who is going to be the abuser? Humans or AI?
In this talk we'll discuss the ethical issues behind the recent AI trends, how open source is going to play a role in a more etichal and safe future and we'll end up in a concrete example, of how ML is applied in the process of drug discovery.
