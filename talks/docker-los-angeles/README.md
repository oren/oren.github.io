# Docker Los Angeles - Lightning Talks

At this month's [Docker Los Angeles Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Los-Angeles/events/232148397) we had an hour dedicated for lighting talks. Each speaker has only 5 minutes. The talks were very entertaining and insightful. It was a great event filled with passionate techies from the local Docker community.
