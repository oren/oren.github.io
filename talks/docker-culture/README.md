## Description

Docker is here to stay whether you like it or not. so embrace it.  
In this talk I'll explain how Docker, Micro Services and Conway Law are going to change not only the way we write software but also the social structure of the entire organization.
I'll talk about Lean, CI and CD and how they are all playing nice with their new friend, Docker.
But I will not stop at theory. I'll dive into the code, tools and technologies that transforms our company, Sanguine, and can help all of the attendees.
