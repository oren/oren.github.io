## Rules to Remember

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **The "Basic Speed Law"** | Never drive faster than is safe for current conditions (weather/traffic), regardless of the posted speed limit. |
| **New 2025 Parking Law** | You cannot park within 20 feet of the approach side of any marked or unmarked crosswalk (to improve pedestrian visibility). |
| **School Buses** | Flash yellow: Slow down and prepare to stop. Flash red: Stop. |
| **Slippery Roads** | Slow down at the first sign of rain, drizzle, or snow. The road is most slippery right when it starts to rain because oil hasn't washed away yet. |
