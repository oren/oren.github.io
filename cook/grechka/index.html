<h1>Grechka Recipies</h1>

<p>Grechka (toasted buckwheat) is a staple of Eastern European cuisine because it is incredibly versatile, gluten-free, and has a deep, nutty flavor.</p>

<p>To get the best results, always use toasted buckwheat (it should be brown, not green). If yours is green, toast it in a dry pan for 3–5 minutes until fragrant before cooking.</p>

<h2>1. Grechka with Mushrooms and Onions (Classic Kasha)</h2>

<p>This is the most iconic way to eat grechka. It works as a hearty side dish or a vegetarian main.</p>

<p>Ingredients: 1 cup grechka, 2 cups water/broth, 1 onion, 8oz mushrooms, butter, salt/pepper, fresh dill.</p>

<p>Method: Sauté diced onions in butter until golden. Add sliced mushrooms and cook until browned. In a separate pot, boil the grechka in salted water until absorbed (about 15 mins). Fold the mushroom-onion mixture into the cooked buckwheat.</p>

<p>Tip: Add a dollop of sour cream on top before serving.</p>

<h2>2. Merchant-Style Buckwheat (Grechka po-Kupecheski)</h2>

<p>Think of this as a &ldquo;one-pot&rdquo; Russian risotto or pilaf. It’s a complete, comforting meal.</p>

<p>Ingredients: 1 cup grechka, 1lb ground meat (beef or pork), 1 onion, 1 carrot (grated), 2 tbsp tomato paste, 2 cups water, garlic.</p>

<p>Method: Brown the meat in a deep skillet. Add onions and carrots, sautéing until soft. Stir in tomato paste and garlic. Add dry grechka and water. Cover and simmer on low for 20 minutes until the water is gone and the buckwheat is fluffy.</p>

<h2>3. Sweet Breakfast Milk Soup</h2>

<p>A nostalgic childhood favorite in many households, similar to oatmeal but with a nuttier bite.</p>

<p>Ingredients: 1 cup cooked grechka, 1.5 cups milk, 1 tbsp honey or sugar, a pinch of salt, butter.</p>

<p>Method: Take already cooked buckwheat and place it in a small saucepan. Pour in the milk and bring to a gentle simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in your sweetener and a knob of butter.</p>

<p>Tip: Serve hot with fresh berries or sliced bananas.</p>

<h2>4. Grechka Breakfast Bowl (Savory)</h2>

<p>A modern, &ldquo;power-bowl&rdquo; twist that is packed with protein.</p>

<p>Ingredients: Cooked grechka, 1 fried or poached egg, ½ avocado, handful of spinach, feta cheese.</p>

<p>Method: Warm up your pre-cooked grechka. Sauté the spinach briefly. Top the buckwheat with the egg, sliced avocado, and crumbled feta. Season with red pepper flakes and a squeeze of lemon.</p>

<h2>5. Grechka &ldquo;Kotlety&rdquo; (Buckwheat Patties)</h2>

<p>A great way to use up leftover buckwheat from the night before.</p>

<p>Ingredients: 2 cups cooked grechka, 1 egg, ½ cup grated cheese, 2 tbsp flour or breadcrumbs, spices (garlic powder, paprika).</p>

<p>Method: Mash the cooked buckwheat slightly or pulse it in a blender so it sticks together. Mix in the egg, cheese, flour, and spices. Form into small patties and pan-fry in oil until crispy and golden on both sides.</p>
