# Grechka Recipies

Grechka (toasted buckwheat) is a staple of Eastern European cuisine because it is incredibly versatile, gluten-free, and has a deep, nutty flavor.

To get the best results, always use toasted buckwheat (it should be brown, not green). If yours is green, toast it in a dry pan for 3–5 minutes until fragrant before cooking.

## 1. Grechka with Mushrooms and Onions (Classic Kasha)

This is the most iconic way to eat grechka. It works as a hearty side dish or a vegetarian main.

Ingredients: 1 cup grechka, 2 cups water/broth, 1 onion, 8oz mushrooms, butter, salt/pepper, fresh dill.

Method: Sauté diced onions in butter until golden. Add sliced mushrooms and cook until browned. In a separate pot, boil the grechka in salted water until absorbed (about 15 mins). Fold the mushroom-onion mixture into the cooked buckwheat.

Tip: Add a dollop of sour cream on top before serving.

A great way to use up leftover buckwheat from the night before.

Ingredients: 2 cups cooked grechka, 1 egg, ½ cup grated cheese, 2 tbsp flour or breadcrumbs, spices (garlic powder, paprika).

Method: Mash the cooked buckwheat slightly or pulse it in a blender so it sticks together. Mix in the egg, cheese, flour, and spices. Form into small patties and pan-fry in oil until crispy and golden on both sides.
