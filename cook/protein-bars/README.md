# Banana Cacao Protein Bars

A chewy, nutrient-dense bar that tastes like a brownie but eats like a meal. It includes the optional egg for structure, the protein powder for macros, and the superfood toppings for that final touch.

**Overview**

 * Yields: 8 Bars
 * Prep time: 10 mins
 * Bake time: 20 mins
 * Oven Temp: 350°F (175°C)

**Ingredients**

The Base:

 * 3 Medium ripe bananas (the more spots, the better)
 * 1.5 cups Old fashioned oats
 * 1/4 cup Unsweetened cacao powder
 * 2 scoops (~60g) Chocolate or vanilla protein powder
 * 1 Large egg
 * 1 tsp Baking powder
 * 1 tsp Vanilla extract
 * 1/2 tsp Cinnamon
 * Pinch of Sea salt
 * (optional) 1 tbsp Hemp hearts

**Instructions**

1. Prep the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line an 8x8 inch square baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a little overhang on the sides for easy removal.
1. Mash & Mix Wet: In a large bowl, mash the bananas until mostly smooth. Whisk in the egg and vanilla extract.
1. Add Dry Ingredients: Stir in the oats, cacao powder, protein powder, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt. Mix until no dry pockets of powder remain. Note: If the batter is very stiff, add 1-2 tbsp of water or almond milk.
1. Press into Pan: Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Use a spatula to press it down firmly and spread it into the corners.
1. Add optional toppings: Sprinkle the hemp hearts and a little extra flaky salt over the top.
1. Bake: Bake for 18–22 minutes. The center should feel set and firm to the touch.
1. Cool & Slice: This is the most important step! Let the bars cool completely in the pan. Lift them out using the parchment paper edges and slice into 8 even bars.
