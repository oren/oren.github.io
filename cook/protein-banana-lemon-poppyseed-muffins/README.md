**Summary**

Prep time: 15 mins | Cook time: 20 mins | Total time: 35 mins Servings: 12 muffins

**Ingredients:**

1.75 cups Oat Flour (blend approx. 2 cups of whole oats to get this)
0.5 cup Protein Powder
2 tbsp Poppyseeds (increased as per original)
1 tsp Baking Soda
1 tsp Baking Powder
0.5 tsp Salt
3 large Ripe Bananas, mashed
2 large Eggs
1 cup Plain Greek Yogurt
2 tbsp Lemon Juice
1 tbsp Lemon Zest

Note: I used all-purpose flour by accident. We'll see how it turned out...

**Instructions:**

1. Prep: Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease your muffin tin well.
1. Blend Oats: Use your hand blender in a narrow container. Blend until you have a fine powder. Measure 1 ¾ cups after blending, not before.
1. Dry Mix: Whisk the oat flour, protein powder, 2 tbsp poppyseeds, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.
1. Wet Mix: In a separate bowl, mash the bananas thoroughly. Whisk in the eggs, Greek yogurt, lemon juice, and zest.
1. The "Oat Soak": Combine wet and dry. Stir until just combined, then let the batter sit for 10 minutes. (Because we are using 100% oats and no sugar, this rest period prevents the muffins from being "mushy" in the middle).
1. Bake: Fill the tins. Bake for 18–22 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean.
