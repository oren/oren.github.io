<h2>Katleti</h2>

<p>This is for katleti - replace ground turkey breast with dark ground turkey, instead of 1 egg white use a whole egg. Grate the onion and use 5 ground garlic cloves. Please saute in a pan…you will dry them up in the oven

<h2>Kasha Varnishkes</h2>

<p>For the buckwheat, just leave out the pasta/varnishkes. If you don’t have chicken stock, I would probably just add consomme to the cooking water for the buckwheat

<h2>Cabbage and tomatoes</h2>

<p>This isn’t specifically Russian, but Russians/Ukranians love cabbage and it is easy to make</p>

<p>For this one, you can even use a deep pan or any other pit, just make sure to cover tightly with parchment paper and aluminum foil
Simplest for you would be the asado, buckwheat and cabbage</p>
