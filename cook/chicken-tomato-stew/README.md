This is a classic Japanese "home cooking" style stew. It's lighter and more soup-like than a thick Italian ragu.

**Japanese Chicken & Tomato Stew (Claire Akibaa Style)**

This recipe focuses on chicken thighs, tomatoes, onion, cabbage, and bouillon.

## Ingredients

**Chicken:** 1 lb (500g) chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces

**Vegetables:**
- 1 medium onion (sliced)
- 1/2 head of cabbage (chopped into large chunks)
- 2-3 large fresh tomatoes (diced) or 1 can of crushed tomatoes

**Liquid/Base:**
- 2 chicken bouillon cubes
- 2 cups of water

**Seasoning:**
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp sugar (to balance the tomato acidity)
- Salt and black pepper

**Optional:**
- 1 clove garlic (minced)
- A splash of sake or white wine

## Instructions

1. **Sear the Chicken:** In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat a little oil over medium-high heat. Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper, then brown them on all sides. You don't need to cook them through yet; just get some color.

2. **Sauté Aromatics:** Add the sliced onions (and garlic, if using) to the pot. Sauté until the onions are translucent and slightly softened.

3. **Build the Stew:** Add the tomatoes and the chopped cabbage. Stir to combine with the chicken and onions.

4. **Simmer:** Pour in the water and add the chicken bouillon cubes. If you have sake, add a splash now to deepen the "umami" flavor.

5. **Cook:** Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for about 15–20 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender and the chicken is fully cooked.

6. **Final Seasoning:** Stir in the soy sauce and sugar. Taste and add more salt or pepper if needed.

## Pro-Tips for an Authentic Taste

- **Cabbage Size:** Don't chop the cabbage too small. Keeping it in large, rustic chunks allows it to soak up the tomato broth without turning into mush.

- **Richness:** For a richer flavor, some Japanese home cooks add a tablespoon of miso paste or a small knob of butter at the very end to give the broth a velvety finish.
