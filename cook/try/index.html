<h2>Vietnamese Cucumber Salad</h2>

<p>Ingredients:
* 2 pounds of cucumbers
* 1 large jalapeno
* 3 scallions, finely sliced
* 1 garlic clove, finely grated or pounded
* ½ cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves
* 16 large mint leaves, chopped coarsely
* ½ cup toasted peanuts, chopped coarsely
* ¼ cup neutral-tasting oil
* 4 teaspoons seasoned rice wine vinegar
* 4 to 5 tablespoons lime juice
* 1 tablespoon fish sauce (optional)
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* Pinch of salt</p>

<p>How to make it:
* Slice cucumbers into coins, discarding the ends.
* In a large bowl, combine the cucumbers, jalapeno, scallions, garlic, cilantro, mint and peanuts.
* In a small bowl, whisk together the oil, 4 tablespoons lime juice, vinegar, fish sauce, sugar and a small pinch of salt.
* Dress the salad with the vinaigrette and toss to combine.
* Adjust seasoning with salt and more lime juice as needed.</p>

<h2>Roasted squash, sage and hazelnut</h2>

<p>Serves 6</p>

<p>Ingredients:
* 1 bunch kale, preferably Lacinato, Cavolo Nero or Tuscan variety
* 1 large butternut squash
* Olive oil
* ½ medium red onion, sliced thinly
* 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
* 2 batches of Balsamic Vinaigrette (separate recipe below)
* 4 cups of torn crouton (store-bought crouton is fine; I use about 2 cups instead)
* 2 cups of neutral tasting oil
* 16 sage leaves
* ¾ cup hazelnuts, toasted and coarsely chopped.</p>

<p>How to make it:
* Preheat the oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with foil.
* Strip the kale. Chop up leaves and discard the stems.
* Cut butternut squash into ¾ inch thick slices, halve them so they’re moon shaped. Roast them in oven at 425 F for about 26 to 30 minutes. Season with salt and coat all of it in olive oil - about 3 tablespoons.
* Toss sliced onion in a small bowl with the vinegar and let it sit for 20 minutes to macerate. Set aside.
* Place half the croutons and the kale in a large salad bowl and toss with ⅓ cup of vinaigrette. Let sit for 10 minutes.
* Fry the sage. Pour an inch of neutral oil into a small, heavy-bottomed pot and heat it over a medium high heat. Should feel hot before dropping in any sage.
* Add the sage leaves in batches. As soon as bubbles tie down (about 30 seconds), pull the sage oil with a slotted spoon or a pair of tongs. Spread the sage onto a plate lined with paper towel (to soak up the extra oil). Sprinkle with salt so it gets crisp as it cools.
* Add the remaining croutons, squash, hazelnuts and macerated onions (but not their vinegar, yet) into the salad bowl. Crumble in the fried sage.Dress with the remaining vinaigrette, toss to combine, and taste. Adjust seasoning with salt, the sage-frying oil, and macerating vinegar as needed. Toss, taste again and serve.</p>

<h2>Balsamic Vinaigrette</h2>

<p>Makes about ⅓ cup</p>

<p>Ingredients:
* 1 tablespoon finely diced shallot
* 1 tablespoon aged balsamic vinegar
* 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
* 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* Salt
* Freshly ground black pepper.</p>

<p>How to make it:
* In a small bowl or jar, the the shallot sit in the vinegar for 15 minutes to acerate, then add the olive oil, a generous pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. Stir or shake to combine, then taste and adjust salt and acid as needed. Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
* Feel free to substitute the olive oil with 4 tablespoons of brown butter and continue as above. Bring refrigerated leftovers back to room temperature before using.</p>
