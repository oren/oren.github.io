## 5 Spice Glazed Chicken
Best served with: Rice or Vietnamese Cucumber Salad

Serves 6

Ingredients:
* 4-pound chicken or 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (breast will also work).
* Salt
* ¼ cup soy sauce
* ¼ cup dark brown sugar
* ¼ cup mirin (rice wine)
* 1 teaspoon sesame oil
* 1 tablespoon finely grated ginger ( I use ginger paste from a tube)
* 4 garlic cloves, finely grated or pounded
* ½ teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder
* ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* ¼ cup coarsely chopped cilantro leaves and tender stems
* 4 scallions, green and white parts slivered.

How to make it:
* Prep the chicken the day before you want to cook. If using a whole chicken, cut into 8 pieces.
* Whisk soy sauce, brown sugar, mirin, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, five-space and cayenne. Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and pour in the marinade. Seal the bat and squish the marinade around so all the chicken is evenly coated. Refrigerate overnight.
* At least one hour before you want to cook the chicken, pull it out of the fridge to come up to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 400 F.
* To cook, place chicken skin side up in a shallow 8 by 13 inch roasting dish, then pour the marinade over the meat. The marinade should cover the bottom of the pan. If it doesn’t, add 2 tablespoons of water to ensure even coverage and prevent burning.
* Remove the breasts, if using, after 20 minutes of cooking to prevent overcooking. Continue to cook dark meat for another 20 to 25 minutes, until it’s tender at the bone, or a total of 45 minutes.
* [Skip if no chicken skin] When the dark meat is cooked, return the breasts to the pan and crank the oven to 450 F to let the sauce reduce and the skin to get dark brown and crisp, about 12 minutes.  Serve warm, garnished with cilantro and slivered scallions.

## Roasted squash, sage and hazelnut
Serves 6

Ingredients:
* 1 bunch kale, preferably Lacinato, Cavolo Nero or Tuscan variety
* 1 large butternut squash
* Olive oil
* ½ medium red onion, sliced thinly
* 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
* 2 batches of Balsamic Vinaigrette (separate recipe below)
* 4 cups of torn crouton (store-bought crouton is fine; I use about 2 cups instead)
* 2 cups of neutral tasting oil
* 16 sage leaves
* ¾ cup hazelnuts, toasted and coarsely chopped.

How to make it:
* Preheat the oven to 425F. Line a baking sheet with foil.
* Strip the kale. Chop up leaves and discard the stems.
* Cut butternut squash into ¾ inch thick slices, halve them so they’re moon shaped. Roast them in oven at 425 F for about 26 to 30 minutes. Season with salt and coat all of it in olive oil - about 3 tablespoons.
* Toss sliced onion in a small bowl with the vinegar and let it sit for 20 minutes to macerate. Set aside.
* Place half the croutons and the kale in a large salad bowl and toss with ⅓ cup of vinaigrette. Let sit for 10 minutes.
* Fry the sage. Pour an inch of neutral oil into a small, heavy-bottomed pot and heat it over a medium high heat. Should feel hot before dropping in any sage.
* Add the sage leaves in batches. As soon as bubbles tie down (about 30 seconds), pull the sage oil with a slotted spoon or a pair of tongs. Spread the sage onto a plate lined with paper towel (to soak up the extra oil). Sprinkle with salt so it gets crisp as it cools.
* Add the remaining croutons, squash, hazelnuts and macerated onions (but not their vinegar, yet) into the salad bowl. Crumble in the fried sage.Dress with the remaining vinaigrette, toss to combine, and taste. Adjust seasoning with salt, the sage-frying oil, and macerating vinegar as needed. Toss, taste again and serve.

## Balsamic Vinaigrette
Makes about ⅓ cup

Ingredients:
* 1 tablespoon finely diced shallot
* 1 tablespoon aged balsamic vinegar
* 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
* 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
* Salt
* Freshly ground black pepper.

How to make it:
* In a small bowl or jar, the the shallot sit in the vinegar for 15 minutes to acerate, then add the olive oil, a generous pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. Stir or shake to combine, then taste and adjust salt and acid as needed. Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
* Feel free to substitute the olive oil with 4 tablespoons of brown butter and continue as above. Bring refrigerated leftovers back to room temperature before using.
