# Pickled Onions

## Ingredients:

* 4-5 habanero peppers, thinly sliced (set aside for the final step)
* 1 medium red onion, thinly sliced
* 1 cup white vinegar
* 1 cup water
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 1 teaspoon black peppercorns
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin (add gradually to taste)
* 2-3 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed

## Instructions:

*Fry the onions*:

- Heat a pan over medium heat. Add a small amount of oil (about 1 tablespoon) and fry the thinly sliced red onions until they become soft and slightly caramelized, about 5-7 minutes.

*Prepare the pickling liquid with the onions*:

- Once the onions are soft, add the garlic, black peppercorns, and *ground cumin* to the pan. Stir for about 30 seconds to let the spices release their aromas. 
- *Note:* Ground cumin is strong, so itâ€™s recommended to add it incrementally. Start with half a teaspoon, taste, and adjust to your preference.
- Add the vinegar, water, and salt directly into the pan with the onions. Stir until the salt dissolves and bring the mixture to a simmer, allowing the flavors to meld together for 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat.

*Assemble in the jar*:

- Place the thinly sliced habanero peppers into a clean mason jar. Carefully pour the hot vinegar-onion mixture over the habaneros, making sure the peppers are fully submerged and the onions are evenly distributed.

*Cool and store*:

- Let the jar cool to room temperature. Once cooled, cover the jar and refrigerate. Allow the pickles to develop flavor for at least 1-2 days, though the flavor will intensify over the course of a week.

## Notes:

*Cumin Tip:* Since ground cumin has a strong, earthy flavor, start with a small amount and adjust according to taste. Adding it incrementally helps avoid overpowering the other ingredients.
These pickles will keep in the fridge for up to 1 month.
