## Eggplant pepper salad

**Ingredients:**

* 3 Eggplants
* Onion
* 3 Big cloves of garlic, crushed
* 2 Red bell peppers
* 1 Chili Pepper / jalapeno (optional)
* Salt & Pepper to taste
* 1 Lemon (optional)
* 1 Bunch of Coriander or parsley (optional)


**How to make it:**

Roast the eggplant and get rid of the peel and squeeze put liquid. Do that by punctured them in a bunch of spots with a fork and place them in the oven on broil until the inside was soft and liquid was coming out (45-60 min).

In a pot/pan sauté finely chopped onions and garlic, bell pepper and a jalapeño and add salt, pepper and sautee in ~1 tbsp oil until soft. When soft, add the eggplant and consommé (1-2 tsp), tomato sauce (canned is fine), paprika (about a tbsp), a little water and mix well. Let cook on low flame and mix once in a while until you get the consistency you like. Adjust seasoning as needed and if you see the flavor is a but acidic, add a 1-2 tsp of sugar

Towards the end add cilantro if you like.
