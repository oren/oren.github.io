# Musubi (午餐肉军舰寿司 / スパムむすび)

**Ingredients:**

Rice:

- 1 cup long-grain brown rice
- 2 cups water
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- Pinch of sugar

Chicken:

- 2 chicken breasts, sliced into rectangles/strips
- 1 tbsp oil for searing
- Salt and pepper

Sauce:

- 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce

Toppings:

- 2 scallions, finely sliced
- Toasted sesame seeds (optional)
- Nori (seaweed) strips

**Instructions:**

1. Rinse 1 cup of brown rice thoroughly.
2. Sauté the dry rice in 1 tsp sesame oil for 2 minutes until it smells toasted.
3. Add 2 cups of water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on low for 45 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and let it rest for 10 minutes (do not open the lid!).
5. Fold in 1 tbsp rice vinegar and half of the sliced scallions.
6. Season chicken strips with salt and pepper. Brown them in a pan over medium-high heat until cooked through (165°F). Remove from pan.
7. In the same pan, add the teriyaki sauce and simmer for 1-2 minutes until it bubbles.
8. Toss the cooked chicken back into the sauce to coat.
9. Lay a strip of nori rough-side up. Place your musubi mold (or a lined Spam tin) in the center.
10. Scoop about 1/2 inch of scallion-brown rice into the mold. Press down very hard.
11. Place a piece of teriyaki chicken on the rice. Sprinkle with more scallions.
12. Optionally add another thin layer of rice on top and press again.
13. Remove the mold and wrap the nori tightly around the block. Use a dab of water or teriyaki sauce to seal the seaweed.

## Additional ingredients (optional)

Since you're already using Brown Rice and Chicken Teriyaki, you have a great base. Because brown rice is heartier and nuttier than white rice, it pairs exceptionally well with ingredients that offer creamy textures, acidic crunch, or intense umami.

Here are four ways to "level up" your musubi:

**1. The "Creamy & Cool" (Avocado)**

The richness of avocado perfectly offsets the chewy texture of brown rice and the saltiness of the teriyaki.

- **How to add it:** Slice thin wedges of ripe avocado and place them directly between the chicken and the rice.
- **Pro Tip:** Squeeze a little lime juice on the avocado first so it doesn't brown if you're packing these for later.

**2. The "Breakfast Twist" (Tamagoyaki/Egg)**

In Hawaii, it's very common to see a layer of egg in musubi. It adds protein and a soft, pillowy texture.

- **How to add it:** Whisk 2 eggs with a splash of water and a pinch of sugar. Fry it in a flat layer, then cut it into rectangles the exact size of your musubi mold.
- **Placement:** Layer it: Rice → Egg → Chicken → Nori.

**3. The "Crunch & Acid" (Quick Pickled Cucumbers)**

Since brown rice and chicken are both "earthy," adding something pickled makes the whole bite feel lighter and fresher.

- **How to add it:** Thinly slice cucumbers and toss them in a splash of your rice vinegar and a pinch of sugar for 10 minutes.
- **Placement:** Put 2–3 slices on top of the chicken before wrapping the seaweed.

**4. The "Umami Bomb" (Furikake & Kimchi)**

If you want bold flavor, this is the route to go.

- **Furikake:** Sprinkle this Japanese seasoning (seaweed flakes, sesame seeds, salt) liberally onto the rice before you put the chicken down. It acts like "glue" and seasoning at the same time.
- **Kimchi:** Chop up some spicy cabbage kimchi and mix it directly into your cooked brown rice. It turns the rice a beautiful orange color and adds a fermented tang.
