For long-grain brown rice, use: 1 cup rice : 2 cups water
(For even fluffier results, some prefer 2 ¼ cups water, but 2 is the standard starting point.)

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Rinse the Rice: Place the rice in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse under cold water for about 30 seconds. This removes excess starch and prevents the rice from becoming gummy.￼
2. Boil the Water: Add the water and a pinch of salt to a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring it to a rolling boil.
3. Simmer: Add the rinsed rice. Once the water returns to a boil, turn the heat down to low.
4. The Seal: Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. If your lid is loose, place a piece of foil over the pot before putting the lid on to trap the steam.
5. Cook (45 Minutes): Let it simmer undisturbed for 45 minutes. Do not lift the lid to "check on it"—you’ll lose the steam needed to soften the bran.
6. The Rest (10 Minutes): This is the most important step. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit, covered, for at least 10 minutes. This allows the moisture to redistribute so the rice pulls away from the bottom of the pot.￼
7. Fluff: Use a fork to gently fluff the grains.

Problem,Cause,Fix
* Still Crunchy,Water evaporated too fast.,"Add 2 tbsp of water and simmer, covered, for 5 more mins."
* Soupy/Wet,Too much water.,Cook uncovered for 2-3 mins to evaporate excess liquid.
* Gummy/Sticky,Stirred during cooking.,"Next time, don't touch the rice until it's finished resting!"

## Brown rice
If you find brown rice a bit too "chewy," try soaking it in cold water for 30 minutes before cooking. It softens the outer bran layer, resulting in a much more tender grain.

1. The Savory All-Rounder (Garlic & Herb)
This is the "go-to" for meal prep. It pairs perfectly with roasted chicken or salmon.

The Swap: Replace half the water with low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth.

The Add-ins: Sauté 2 cloves of minced garlic in a bit of olive oil before adding the rice and water.

The Finish: Once fluffed, stir in a handful of chopped fresh parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice.

2. The "Better Than Takeout" (Toasted Sesame)
If you’re making that Chicken Musubi from earlier, this is a great base.

The Add-ins: Add 1 tsp of Toasted Sesame Oil and 1 tbsp of Soy Sauce to the cooking water.

The Finish: Top with a generous amount of Furikake or toasted sesame seeds and sliced green onions.

Ingredients:
* 1 cup of brown rice
* 1 tsp Toasted Sesame Oil
* 1 tbsp Soy Sauce (reduce the salt in your water if you do this!)
* 1–2 tsp Rice Vinegar (add to taste at the very end)

3. The Bright & Zesty (Cilantro Lime)
Perfect for burrito bowls, tacos, or black beans.

The Add-ins: Cook the rice as normal with a bay leaf in the pot.

The Finish: After the 10-minute rest, stir in the juice of 1 whole lime, a zest of that lime, and a half-cup of chopped fresh cilantro.

4. The Golden Glow (Turmeric & Ginger)
Anti-inflammatory and visually stunning. This goes beautifully with curries or stir-fries.

The Add-ins: Add 1/2 tsp Turmeric powder, 1/2 tsp Ground Ginger (or 1.5 tsp of grated ginger), and a crack of black pepper to the water.

The Pro Move: Stir in a tablespoon of coconut milk right at the end for a creamy texture.
