<h1>Wardley Maps and Cynefin Framework</h1>

<p>Liz gave a fantastic talk at Agendashift 2021 conference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cynefin is a framework for making sense of different situations, depending on how predictable or unpredictable they are. Wardley Mapping is a method for developing strategy, depending on the maturity and visibility of the components involved. There are some obvious commonalities between them, and both are helpful for making decisions - but what is it that makes them different? And what can we do differently by looking at them together?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this talk, Liz introduces, compares and contrasts both frameworks, looking at the constraints in play, the dynamics, and the all-too-common antipatterns for both.</p>

<p>Here is a text version of the talk</p>
