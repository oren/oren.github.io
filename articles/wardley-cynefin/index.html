<h1>Wardley Maps and Cynefin Framework</h1>

<p>Liz gave a fantastic talk at Agendashift 2021 conference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Cynefin is a framework for making sense of different situations, depending on how predictable or unpredictable they are. Wardley Mapping is a method for developing strategy, depending on the maturity and visibility of the components involved. There are some obvious commonalities between them, and both are helpful for making decisions - but what is it that makes them different? And what can we do differently by looking at them together?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this talk, Liz introduces, compares and contrasts both frameworks, looking at the constraints in play, the dynamics, and the all-too-common antipatterns for both.</p>

<p>Here is a text version of the talk</p>

* Innovation cycle - tell the pokemon go story. cameras become a comodity. that lead to innovations like pokemon go.
* Shallow dive into choas
* Small precentage of things stablize

<h2>What is Wardley Maps?</h2>

<h2>Why mapping is key for innovation?</h2>
