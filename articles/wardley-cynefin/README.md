# Wardley Maps and Cynefin Framework

Liz gave a fantastic talk at Agendashift 2021 conference.

> Cynefin is a framework for making sense of different situations, depending on how predictable or unpredictable they are. Wardley Mapping is a method for developing strategy, depending on the maturity and visibility of the components involved. There are some obvious commonalities between them, and both are helpful for making decisions - but what is it that makes them different? And what can we do differently by looking at them together?

In this talk, Liz introduces, compares and contrasts both frameworks, looking at the constraints in play, the dynamics, and the all-too-common antipatterns for both.

Here is a text version of the talk

Cynefin Dynamics:
* Innovation cycle - tell the pokemon go story. cameras become a comodity. that lead to innovations like pokemon go.
* Shallow dive into choas
* small precentage of things stablize
