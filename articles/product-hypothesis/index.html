<h1>Product Hypothesis</h1>

<p>Go quicker to product market fit by Bridgding the gap between products manager and statisticians.</p>

<p>Teach product managers how to use experimental designs together with a Press Release, Frequently Asked Quesitions (PRFAQ) document.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>How to increase social interaction of autistic kids.</p>

<p>Hypothesis: kids with autism who had intervention applied behavioral analysis (aba) are more likely to find a partner in their adult life.</p>

<p>The hypothesis define the experimental design. It means what are we comparing to and what we measure (okrs).</p>

<p>Product manger can say that &ldquo;even if you answer this hypothesis and I trust your answer, it will still not bring me value&rdquo;. The statistician can ask what hypothesis will bring you value.</p>
