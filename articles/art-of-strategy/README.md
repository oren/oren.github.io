# Art of Strategy

This the practical insights from book [The Art of Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/ART-STRATEGY-Towards-Business-Agility/dp/B086PTDZT1) by Erik Schön.

Erik took 3 ideas ([Art of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War), [OODA Loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop), and [Wardley Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wardley_map)) and wrapped them together to create a new mechanism for building and managing a strategy. In this page I will describes the mental model of this mechanism and I will also conclude with alternatives or suggestions for modifying it.

## 1. Mental Model of the mechanism
Purpose: create and maintain successful strategy.

How? develop the strategy using The Art of War, make choices using OODA Loops, and deploy the strategy using Wardley Maps.

## 2. Suggestions
I have a few questions regarding this mechanism. Is there a way to measure the it's effectiveness? Can we replace or add an idea/component to make it more effective?

Here are a few ideas I plan to explore:
* Identify your biggest challenge that can be solved. That's strategy - [Richard Rumelt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83vczUPiMv0)
* Allocate resources toward emerging strategies - [Rita Gunther McGrath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1JIuRvJxKw). I am thinking of calling this 'strategy spikes'.
* Increase the number of leaders in your organization via creating small groups, visible P&L, foster leaders without formal authority - [Gary Hamel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mCmecrnLUM). I am thinking of calling this 'democratizing leadership'.
