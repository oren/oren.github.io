# Art of Strategy

This the practical insights from book [The Art of Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/ART-STRATEGY-Towards-Business-Agility/dp/B086PTDZT1) by Erik Schön.


Erik took 3 ideas (Art of War, OODA Loop, and Wardley Maps) and wrapped them together to create a new mechanism for building and managing a strategy. This page will describe the mental model of this mechanism and will also evaluate it's effectiveness. Lastly, this page will suggest a few ideas to increase it's effectiveness and adoption rate.

## 1. Mental Model of the mechanism
Purpose: create and maintain successful strategy.

How? develop the strategy using The Art of War, make choices using OODA Loops, and deploy the strategy using Wardley Maps.
