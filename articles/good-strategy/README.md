# How to create a good strategy?

![strategy](strategy-kernel.png)

## 1. What is a strategy?
A strategy have 3 components:
* Diagnosis - what's the nature of the problem?
* Guiding Policies - our basic approach to solve the problem.
* Actions - implementation details of the policies.

## 2. What is a good strategy?
Two aspects of a good strategy:
1. It coordinates policy and actions using objectives.
2. It enables new strength through subtle shifts in viewpoints.

Advantages such as being a first mover, scale, scope, network effects, reputation, patents, brands, and many others are useful but they don't make a strategy good.

## 3. Sources of power
*Note: This section is under development*

* Using leverage
* Proximate objectives
* Chain-link systems
* Using design
* Focus
* Growth
* Using advantage
* Using dynamics
* Inertia and entropy

## 4. Examples of a Bad Strategy

### Strategy A:

* Challenge: 40% of students in LA are dropping out. How to improve it?
* Actions: let's hire better teachers or let's buy better books.

This is not a strategy since it's doesn't include a diagnosis of the probelm and also missing a guiding policy.

### Strategy B:

* Challenge: Greece borrowed more money than they can pay back. How to prevent that in the future?
* Actions: bail out the banks, do a better math before borrowing money or don't anticipate growth if there was no growth in the last 10 years.

This is not a strategy since it's doesn't include a diagnosis of the probelm and also missing a guiding policy.

### Strategy C:

* Challenge: the unemployment rate in the US during Covid reached 14.4%. How to lower it back to 3.8%?
* Statement: we need to drop the unemployment rate to a single digit and we'll do that by working together as a strong nation.

This is not a strategy. It's an objective. There is no diagnosis of the problem, no guiding policy, and no coherent actions.
