Understand the two types of innovation: Sustaining vs Disruptive Innovation

Understand the levers of the system:
* Interdependent vs Modular Architecture
* Resources vs Process vs Values
* Pioneer vs follower

Guidelines
1. Never target an incumbent with a sustaining solution
1. Customers ‘hire’ products to get specific ‘jobs’ done
1. Core competence is a dangerously inward-looking notion
1. Proprietary architectures lead to overshooting what the market needs
1. Use the emergent strategy to develop disruptive innovations
1. Appoint people for their ability to learn, not their track record
1. Be patient for growth and impatient for profit
1. Launching disruptive businesses can be a repeatable process
