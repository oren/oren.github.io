# Relationship Guidelines

Don't allow society dictate how your relationships should look like. You can custom design your relationships: decide what aspects to include and/or exclude, and where boundaries are for each relationship.

Guidelines:

* Don't rank the people you care about, as each relationship is independent.
* Respect others' independence, and try not to be entitled and demanding of people.
* Find what's important to you and set your own core values and use them for all your relationships.
* Don't allow the normative social system in place to dictate how you should live, and what relationships you should be in.
* Be spontaneous.
* Give your loved ones lots of opportunities to communicate, and allow them to withdraw if they need to, as long as you don't compromise on your values.
* Realise what commitments are right for you, and see where your relationships fit in with that â€” whether that's owning a house, having children, etc.
