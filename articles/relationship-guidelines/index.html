	<h1>Relationship Guidelines</h1>
<p>Don't allow society dictate how your relationships should look like. You can custom design your relationships: decide what aspects to include and/or exclude, and where boundaries are for each relationship.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't rank the people you care about, as each relationship is independent.</li>
<li>Respect others' independence, and try not to be entitled and demanding of people.</li>
<li>Find what's important to you and set your own core values and use them for all your relationships.</li>
<li>Don't allow the normative social system in place to dictate how you should live, and what relationships you should be in.</li>
<li>Be spontaneous.</li>
<li>Give your loved ones lots of opportunities to communicate, and allow them to withdraw if they need to, as long as you don't compromise on your values.</li>
<li>Realise what commitments are right for you, and see where your relationships fit in with that â€” whether that's owning a house, having children, etc.</li>
</ul>
