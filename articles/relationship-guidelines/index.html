<h1>Relationship Guidelines</h1>

<p>Don&rsquo;t allow society dictate how your relationships should look like. You can custom design your relationships: decide what aspects to include and/or exclude, and where boundaries are for each relationship.</p>

<p>Guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t rank the people you care about, as each relationship is independent.</li>
<li>Respect others&rsquo; independence, and try not to be entitled and demanding of people.</li>
<li>Find what&rsquo;s important to you and set your own core values and use them for all your relationships.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t allow the normative social system in place to dictate how you should live, and what relationships you should be in.</li>
<li>Be spontaneous.</li>
<li>Give your loved ones lots of opportunities to communicate, and allow them to withdraw if they need to, as long as you don&rsquo;t compromise on your values.</li>
<li>Realise what commitments are right for you, and see where your relationships fit in with that â€” whether that&rsquo;s owning a house, having children, etc.</li>
</ul>
