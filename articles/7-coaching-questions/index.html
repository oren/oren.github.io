<h1>7 Coaching Questions</h1>

<p>When you coach someone, use any of the following questions:
* <strong>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind?&rdquo;</strong>. The kickstart question encourages the individual to start the conversation by sharing what&rsquo;s important to them.
* <strong>&ldquo;And what else?&rdquo;</strong>. The AWE Question prompts the person to delve deeper into their thoughts, feelings, and ideas, encouraging a more comprehensive exploration of the issue.
* <strong>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the real challenge here for you?&rdquo;</strong>. The Focus Question helps clarify the core issue or problem the individual is facing, steering the conversation toward a more precise focus.
* <strong>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</strong>. The Foundation question encourages the person to articulate their goals, desires, or objectives, fostering clarity about what they truly want.
* <strong>&ldquo;How can I help?&rdquo;</strong>. The Lazy question invites the person to consider how the coach or leader can be of assistance and empowers them to take ownership of the solution.
* <strong>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re saying yes to this, what are you saying no to?&rdquo;</strong>. The Strategic question helps individuals recognize the trade-offs and consequences of their choices, fostering better decision-making.
* <strong>&ldquo;What was most useful or valuable here for you?&rdquo;</strong>. The Learning question encourages reflection and learning after the conversation, allowing the person to identify key takeaways and insights.</p>
