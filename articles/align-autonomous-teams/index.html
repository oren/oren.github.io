<h1>Why and How to Align Autonomous Teams</h1>

<h2>1. Situation</h2>

<p>You are leading an organization of 100 autonomous stream-aligned teams (500 people at various tech/leadership roles - Engineers, Engineering Managers, Product Managers, Program Managers). Some teams solve the same problems that other teams solved already. Increasing alignment between those some teams will increase innovation of the organization.</p>

<h2>2. Task</h2>

<p>Increase alignment and innovation without decreasing speed of delivery.</p>

<h2>3. Action</h2>

<p>Build an enablement organization that operates as an internal open source community of champions. The organization works on standards that stream-aligned teams adopt if there is a strategic fit.</p>

<h2>4. Result</h2>

<p>The community codify standards in libraries and services. Teams that adopt the standards increase their innovation rate and strategic alignment (if applicable). Example for standards: DevOps, Security, Compliance, and Operational Excellence (OE).</p>

<h2>Concepts</h2>

<ul>
<li>Stream-aligned team: aligned to a flow of work from (usually) a segment of the business domain.</li>
<li>Enabling Team: helps a Stream-aligned team to overcome obstacles. Also detects missing capabilities.</li>
<li>Complicated Subsystem team: where significant mathematics/calculation/technical expertise is needed.</li>
<li>Platform team: a grouping of other team types that provide a compelling internal product to accelerate delivery by Stream-aligned teams.</li>
</ul>
