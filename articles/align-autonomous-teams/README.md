# Why and How to Align Autonomous Teams

## 1. Situation
You are leading an organization of 100 autonomous stream-aligned teams (500 people at various tech/leadership roles - Engineers, Engineering Managers, Product Managers, Program Managers). Some teams solve the same problems that other teams solved already. Increasing alignment between those some teams will increase innovation of the organization.

## 2. Task
Increase alignment and innovation without decreasing speed of delivery.

## 3. Action
Build an enablement organization that operates as an internal open source community of champions. The organization works on standards that stream-aligned teams adopt if there is a strategic fit.

## 4. Result
Community codify standards in libraries and services. Teams that adopt the standards increase their innovation rate and strategic alignment (if applicable). Example for standards: DevOps, Security, Compliance, and Operational Excellence (OE).

## Concepts
* Stream-aligned team: aligned to a flow of work from (usually) a segment of the business domain.
* Enabling Team: helps a Stream-aligned team to overcome obstacles. Also detects missing capabilities.
* Complicated Subsystem team: where significant mathematics/calculation/technical expertise is needed.
* Platform team: a grouping of other team types that provide a compelling internal product to accelerate delivery by Stream-aligned teams.
