<h2>Databases on AWS: The Right Tool for the Right Job (DAT205-R1)</h2>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-pb-DkD6cWg</p>
<p>Exploring a purpose-built strategy for databases, where you choose the right tool for the job. Shawn explains why your application should drive the requirements of a database, not the other way around. We introduce AWS databases that are purpose-built for your application use cases. Learn why you should select different database services to solve different aspects of an application, and watch a demonstration in which application use cases lend themselves well to specific data services. If you're a developer building modern applications that require high performance, scale, and functional databases, and you're trying to determine which relational and non-relational data services to use, this session is for you.</p>
<p>Mapping usecases to a Database: relational, key-value, document, in-memory, graph, time-series, ledger.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Messaging Service for Your Distributed App (API305)</h2>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-JmX6MIDDI</p>
<p>In the cloud, modern apps are decoupled into independent building blocks, called microservices, which are easier to develop, deploy, and maintain. Messaging is a central tool used to connect and coordinate these microservices. AWS offers multiple messaging services, which address a variety of use cases. In this session, learn how to choose the service that’s best for your use case as we present the key technical features of each. We pay special attention to integrating messaging services with serverless technology. We cover Amazon Kinesis, Amazon SQS, and Amazon SNS in detail with discussion of other services as appropriate.</p>

<h2>A Serverless Journey: AWS Lambda Under the Hood (SRV409-R1)</h2>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdzV04T_kec</p>
<p>Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without thinking about servers. Serverless applications don't require you to provision, scale, and manage any servers. However, under the hood, there is a sophisticated architecture that takes care of all the undifferentiated heavy lifting for the developer. Join Holly Mesrobian, Director of Engineering, and Marc Brooker, Senior Principal of Engineering, to learn how AWS architected one of the fastest-growing AWS services. In this session, we show you how Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code with high availability</p>

<h2>The Future of Enterprise Applications is Serverless (ENT314-R1)</h2>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_fZU6hSQkA</p>
<p>At re:Invent 2014, we announced AWS Lambda and ushered in a whole new world of application design, one without the need to manage or think about traditional server infrastructure. Since then, serverless has become one of the hottest topics in the industry. Customers like Capital One and Coca Cola talk about how serverless saved them time and money, helped them reduce their operational burden, and drove developer agility and innovation. What is serverless, and what are the key trends you should be aware of? Where does one start on the journey of building serverless applications? We cover all of this and more in this session.</p>

<h2>Technology Choices for Modern Applications (SRV305-R1)</h2>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPOvrK3S3gQ</p>
<p>AWS offers a wide range of cloud computing services and technologies, but we rarely state opinions about which services and technologies customers should choose. When it comes to building our own services, our engineering groups have strong opinions, and they express them in the technologies they pick. Join Tim Bray, Senior Principal Engineer, to hear about the high-level choices that developers at AWS and our customers have to make. Here are a few: Are microservices always the way to go? Serverless, containers, or serverless containers? Is relational over? Is Java over? The talk is technical and based on our experience in building AWS services and working with customers on their cloud-native apps.</p>

<h2>How HSBC Uses Serverless to Process Millions of Transactions in Real Time (FSV305)</h2>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UiyIJqDXXQ</p>
<p>For large financial institutions, it can be extremely hard to predict when your architecture may need to scale to process millions of financial transactions per day. HSBC addressed this challenge by integrating its on-premises mainframe with AWS services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon Kinesis, and Amazon DynamoDB. This integration enables the bank to engage in real time with millions of retail banking customers in a more personal, dynamic, and useful way. The bank applies business logic to its transaction data, and it harnesses the information it gleans to communicate directly with customers through a messaging platform that runs on AWS. In this session, we share an architecture pattern that demonstrates how retail banks can add value by investing in their legacy system when integrating streaming data from on-premises systems to an event-driven, serverless architecture at scale.

<h2>Applying Principles of Chaos Engineering to Serverless (DVC305)</h2>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYJDfsTklH0</p>
<p>Chaos engineering focuses on improving system resilience through controlled experiments, exposing the inherent chaos and failure modes in our system before they manifest in production and impact users. However, much of the publicized tools and articles focus on killing Amazon EC2 instances, and the efforts in the serverless community have been largely limited to moving those tools into Lambda functions. How can we apply the same principles of chaos to a serverless architecture built around AWS Lambda functions? Can we adapt existing practices to expose the inherent chaos in these systems? What are the limitations and new challenges that we need to consider? Come to this session and find out.</p>

<h2>From Monolith to Modern Apps: Best Practices (SRV322-R2)</h2>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWcpmJCFhTM</p>
<p>We are a lean team consisting of developers, lead architects, business analysts, and a project manager. To scale our applications and optimize costs, we need to reduce the amount of undifferentiated heavy lifting (e.g., patching, server management) from our projects. We have identified AWS serverless services that we will use. However, we need approval from a security and cost perspective. We need to build a business case to justify this paradigm shift for our entire technology organization. In this session, we learn to migrate existing applications and build a strategy and financial model to lay the foundation to build everything in a truly serverless way on AWS.</p>
