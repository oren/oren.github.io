# Toxic Relationship Behaviors

Toxic Behaviors and what to do instead:

* **You remind your friend about their past mistakes.** Do This instead: Be present. Don't discuss past mistakes if they are not relevant anymore.
* **You don't say what bothers you.** Do This instead: Express what you feel and want. Don't let your friend guess.
* **You threat to leave the relationship if you don't like something.** Do This instead: Communicate your needs instead.
* **You blame someone for your own emotions.** Do This instead: Your emotions are independent of other people's actions. If you feel something, it's because you chose this feeling.
* **Feel anger or jealous when your friend communicate with others.** Do This instead: It's ok to feel Jelaous. Build trust: express your emotions and talk about boundries.
