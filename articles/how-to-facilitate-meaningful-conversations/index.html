<h2 id="1-problem--opportunity">1. Problem / Opportunity</h2>
<p>You joined a new team or organization and have one-on-ones with 25 people in 10 days. How do you connect with people, build trust, and learn about their internal landscape? How do you achieve that in 30-minute conversations?</p>
<h2 id="2-solution">2. Solution</h2>
<p>Create a psychologically safe environment by using a technique called Clean Language. When the other person shares something that you want to learn more about, ask a question in a way that allows them to use their own vocabulary and metaphors.</p>
<p>Here are a few questions you can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you want to know more about the <strong>outcome or future</strong> of a situation, ask "What happens next?".</li>
<li>If you want to understand what <strong>previous</strong> event led to a situation, ask "Where does… come from?" or "What happens just before?".</li>
<li>If you want to get <strong>details</strong> about a situation, ask "What kind of…?" or "Is there anything else about…?".</li>
<li>If you want to learn about the <strong>location</strong> of a situation, ask "Where is…?".</li>
<li>If you want to <strong>reveal a metaphor</strong>, ask "What's that like?" or "That’s… like what?".</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example-of-a-clean-conversation">Example of a clean conversation</h3>
<p>Let's see an example of using Clean Language techniques in conversations.</p>
<p>You: What challenges are important for the team?</p>
<p>Them: the team needs a testing environment.</p>
<p>Non-clean answer: What kind of software do you need? (don't use words the person didn't use. Let them come up with their own vocabulary).</p>
<p>Clean answer: What kind of testing environment?</p>
<p>Them: my head explodes when I try to test our services together with it's dependent services.</p>
<p>Non-clean answer: does it frustrate you? (don't guess their emotions, let them share their world in their own language and metaphors).</p>
<p>Clean answer: and then what happened?</p>
<p>Them: Last week we had a production outage that impacted our customer and our testing environment didn't detect that.</p>

<p>Clean Language is a communication and coaching technique developed by David Grove, a psychotherapist and researcher. Its primary value proposition lies in its ability to facilitate clear, open, and non-judgmental communication while exploring a person's thoughts, feelings, and experiences. The technique is often used in coaching, therapy, counseling, and various forms of personal development.</p>
