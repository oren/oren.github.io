<h1>How to facilitate meaningful conversations</h1>

<h2>1. Problem / Opportunity</h2>

<p>You joined a new team or organization and have one-on-ones with 25 people in 10 days. How do you connect with people, build trust, and learn about their internal landscape? How do you achieve that in 30-minute conversations?</p>

<h2>2. Solution</h2>

<p>Create a psychologically safe environment by using a technique called Clean Language. When the other person shares something that you want to learn more about, ask a question in a way that allows them to use their own vocabulary and metaphors.</p>

<p>Here are a few questions you can use:
* If you want to know more about the <strong>outcome or future</strong> of a situation, ask &ldquo;What happens next?&rdquo;.
* If you want to understand what <strong>previous</strong> event led to a situation, ask &ldquo;Where does… come from?&rdquo; or &ldquo;What happens just before?&rdquo;.
* If you want to get <strong>details</strong> about a situation, ask &ldquo;What kind of…?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Is there anything else about…?&rdquo;.
* If you want to learn about the <strong>location</strong> of a situation, ask &ldquo;Where is…?&rdquo;.
* If you want to <strong>reveal a metaphor</strong>, ask &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that like?&rdquo; or &ldquo;That’s… like what?&rdquo;.</p>

<h3>Example of a clean conversation</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s see an example of using Clean Language techniques in conversations.</p>

<p>You: What challenges are important for the team?</p>

<p>Them: the team needs a testing environment.</p>

<p>Non-clean answer: What kind of software do you need? (don&rsquo;t use words the person didn&rsquo;t use. Let them come up with their own vocabulary).</p>

<p>Clean answer: What kind of testing environment?</p>

<p>Them: my head explodes when I try to test our services together with it&rsquo;s dependent services.</p>

<p>Non-clean answer: does it frustrate you? (don&rsquo;t guess their emotions, let them share their world in their own language and metaphors).</p>

<p>Clean answer: and then what happened?</p>

<p>Them: Last week we had a production outage that impacted our customer and our testing environment didn&rsquo;t detect that.</p>

<h2>3. Behind the scenes</h2>

<p>Clean Language is a communication and coaching technique developed by David Grove, a psychotherapist and researcher. Its primary value proposition lies in its ability to facilitate clear, open, and non-judgmental communication while exploring a person&rsquo;s thoughts, feelings, and experiences. The technique is often used in coaching, therapy, counseling, and various forms of personal development.</p>
