<p>Clean answer: What kind of testing environment?</p>
<p>Them: my head explodes when I try to test our services together with it's dependent services.</p>
<p>Non-clean answer: does it frustrate you? (don't guess their emotions, let them share their world in their own language and metaphors).</p>
<p>Clean answer: and then what happened?</p>
<p>Them: Last week we had a production outage that impacted our customer and our testing environment didn't detect that.</p>
