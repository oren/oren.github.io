# How to apologize

How to apologize and repair a relationship?

> "the purpose of mistakes is to help us to see ourselves."

## The process
1. Admit.
2. Apologize.
3. Tell what you would do differently (repair).
4. Demonstrate doing the right action in a similar situation.

Note: this process is borrowed from Judaism. If you know a better process, let me know!
