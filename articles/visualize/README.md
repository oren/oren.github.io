# Visualizing Software Architecture

## 1. Problem
Teams are struggling to desribe their software to various audiences. They use confusing diagrams with ambiguously named boxes, unclear responsibilities, unexplained symbols, ambiguous relationships between elements, no key/legend, and unclear abstractions.

## 2. Solution
Create software architecture diagrams that would be easy for anybody on the project team to understand - use different levels of abstraction (high level, component level, and even code) and include user stories.

## 3. Demo of Terrastruct - diagraming tool
I found an interesting tool that allow you to create diagrams at multiple levels, zoom into components, and also add user stories.
