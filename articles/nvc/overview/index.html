<h1>Overview of NVC</h1>

<h2>1. What is it?</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">NVC</a> is a process to build stronger relationships by resolving disagreement, negotiation, and conflict.

<li><strong>Observation</strong> - State what you see and hear. Don&rsquo;t judge or evaluate.</li>

<li><strong>Request</strong> - Make a request for action to meet the need. Use positive language, it&rsquo;s not a demand.</li>
</ol>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>[need]</strong> Make sense! I want you to feel comfortable with my friends.  You know, Ben share your passion for surfing.  <strong>[request]</strong> Can I ask him to share his recent surfing adventure? He won&rsquo;t be able to shut up (:</p>
