## 1. Summary

**Observation:** Wendy told me that May said something along those lines "no offence but I don't understand why you like Oren" at multiple occasions and in front of a few people. Wendy mentioned that you heard it as well.
**Feeling:** annoyed and embarrassed
**Unmet needs:** respect, support, and growth
**Request:** ask the person who said it to go to a private place with you and discuss it there. Ask that person to provide the evidence (things I said or did) that support thier claim. Suggest to this person to talk to me instead of delivering the feedback to you. Share with me the claim and the data points.

## 2. Delivery

Hi Sarah, Wendy told me that last Friday May said something along those lines: "no offence Wendy, but I don't understand why you like Oren" at multiple occasions and in front of a few people. Wendy mentioned that you heard it as well. I felt annoyed and embarrassed because it was done not in a private setting, it was not backed up by evidence, and Wendy or you didn't stop this conversation. I value your friendship and expect my friends to do the following whenever someone is saying something negative about me: first, ask the person to go to a private location and discuss it there. Second, ask for data points that backup their claim, third, suggest this person to talk to me instead of you, and lastly, share with me the claim and any data points. Doing those simple steps will allow me to grow as a person, and make me feel valued and protected by my friends. I would protect you Jeff, Huong, and Wendy (and anyone who I consider a friend) if someone would claim anything negative in public about you and I expect the same from any of my friends. Let me know what you think! I value your opinions.
