## 2. Delivery

Hi May, Wendy told me that last Friday you told her you don't understand why she likes me. Sarah and your friends were there as well. Wendy was shocked, surprised, and confused and after she told me what you said I felt confused and annoyed. We felt that way because this claim was said with no supporting data points and it was said in front of other people. I have two requests for you: can you share with me the actions or things I said to you (or you heard from someone) that causes you to not understand why Wendy likes me? Also, in the future can you provide such feedback privately? If you are uncomfortable to deliver it directly to me, you can deliver it to Wendy. Both Wendy and I value compassionate, respectful, data-driven, and direct communication and we see it as a growth opportunity. Let me know what you think.
