This is a crash course on [Social Lab](https://www.collaboratiohelvetica.ch/en/blog/2020/4/15/social-innovation-lab-canvas)

## What?
Tackle the root causes of a challenge and have systemic impact, rather than fight symptoms.

## How?
* Sit down in a nice and quiet spot.
* Perhaps meditate or enjoy a few minutes of silence.
* Look at your [Social Innovation Lab Canvas](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58ba9bbdd1758e6cdb80fb67/t/5ea9360ee8098b7653285cd1/1588147727365/Social_Innovation_Lab_Canvas--Nov2019.pdf) and start by writing down the challenge you are trying to address.
* [Map out the system](https://www.collaboratiohelvetica.ch/en/blog/2019/10/18/system-mapping) that you are part of that is affected by or inherently intertwined with this challenge.
* Your [calling question](https://www.collaboratiohelvetica.ch/en/blog/2019/11/26/the-art-of-powerful-calling-and-guiding-questions) should be formulated in a way that it gives a certain strategic direction and scope, contributing to clarifying who should be part of the Lab. It therefore needs to be formulated in such a way that it does not de-facto excludes some of the stakeholders you absolutely must include.
* In order to design the process, the defining elements include who should be there, where it ought to take place, and how much can you invest in accommodations.

## Definitions
