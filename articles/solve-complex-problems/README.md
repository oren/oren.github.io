# How to solve complex problems?
This is a crash course on [Social Lab](https://www.collaboratiohelvetica.ch/en/blog/2020/4/15/social-innovation-lab-canvas)

## What?
Tackle the root causes of a challenge and have systemic impact, rather than fight symptoms.

## How?
* Sit down in a nice and quiet spot.
* Perhaps meditate or enjoy a few minutes of silence.
* Look at your [Social Innovation Lab Canvas](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58ba9bbdd1758e6cdb80fb67/t/5ea9360ee8098b7653285cd1/1588147727365/Social_Innovation_Lab_Canvas--Nov2019.pdf) and start by writing down the challenge you are trying to address.
* [Map out the system](https://www.collaboratiohelvetica.ch/en/blog/2019/10/18/system-mapping) that you are part of that is affected by or inherently intertwined with this challenge.
* Your [calling question](https://www.collaboratiohelvetica.ch/en/blog/2019/11/26/the-art-of-powerful-calling-and-guiding-questions) should be formulated in a way that it gives a certain strategic direction and scope, contributing to clarifying who should be part of the Lab. It therefore needs to be formulated in such a way that it does not de-facto excludes some of the stakeholders you absolutely must include.
* In order to design the process, the defining elements include who should be there, where it ought to take place, and how much can you invest in accommodations. For this step, as it is a whole field and profession in and of itself, we recommend you refer to a person whose expertise is designing and facilitating such processes, whom we call Practitioners.
