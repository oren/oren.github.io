<h1>Practical Deep Learning for Coders (online course. cost: 5 days)</h1>

<h2>1. What</h2>

<p>Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD - crash course (8 lessons in 8 days)</p>

<h2>2. Why</h2>

<p>What you will learn:
* How to train models that achieve state-of-the-art results in Computer vision, Natural language processing (NLP), Tabular data (e.g., sales prediction), Collaborative filtering (e.g., movie recommendation)
* How to turn your models into web applications, and deploy them
* Why and how deep learning models work, and how to use that knowledge to improve the accuracy, speed, and reliability of your models
* The latest deep learning techniques that really matter in practice
* How to implement stochastic gradient descent and a complete training loop from scratch
* How to think about the ethical implications of your work, to help ensure that you&rsquo;re making the world a better place and that your work isn&rsquo;t misused for harm</p>
