<h1>Practical Deep Learning for Coders (online course. cost: 5 days)</h1>
<p>Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD - crash course (5 days)</p>
<p>.What you don't need to do deep learning</p>
<p>| Myth (don't need) | Truth
| Lots of math | Just high school math is sufficient
| Lots of data | We've seen record-breaking results with &lt;50 items of data
| Lots of expensive computers | You can get what you need for state of the art work for free</p>
<h2>1. Do you need these for deep learning?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lots of math T / F</li>
<li>Lots of data T / F</li>
<li>Lots of expensive computers T / F</li>
<li>A PhD T / F</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer: F, F, F, F</p>
<h2>2. Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.</h2>
<p>Answer: Natural language processing (NLP), Computer vision, Medicine, Biology.</p>
<p>Just for your FYI, here is are more areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural language processing (NLP):: Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles mentioning a concept</li>
<li>Computer vision:: Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience); face recognition; image captioning; reading traffic signs; locating pedestrians and vehicles in autonomous vehicles</li>
<li>Medicine:: Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images; counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diagnosing diabetic retinopathy</li>
<li>Biology:: Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions</li>
<li>Image generation:: Colorizing images; increasing image resolution; removing noise from images; converting images to art in the style of famous artists</li>
<li>Recommendation systems:: Web search; product recommendations; home page layout</li>
<li>Playing games:: Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games</li>
<li>Robotics:: Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking texture) or hard to pick up</li>
<li>Other applications:: Financial and logistical forecasting, text to speech, and much more...</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?</h2>
<h2>4. Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?</h2>
<h2>5. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?</h2>
<h2>6. What is a GPU?</h2>
<h2>7. Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: 1+1. What happens?</h2>
<h2>8. Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen.</h2>
<h2>9. Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix.</h2>
<h2>10. Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?</h2>
<h2>11. What did Samuel mean by &quot;weight assignment&quot;?</h2>
<h2>12. What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called &quot;weights&quot;?</h2>
<h2>13. Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel's view of a machine learning model.</h2>
<h2>14. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?</h2>
<h2>15. What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?</h2>
<h2>16. What do you need in order to train a model?</h2>
<h2>17. How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?</h2>
<h2>18. Do we always have to use 224Ã—224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?</h2>
<h2>19. What is the difference between classification and regression?</h2>
<h2>20. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?</h2>
<h2>21. What will fastai do if you don't provide a validation set?</h2>
