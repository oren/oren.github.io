# Question for the end of lesson 1

### 1. Do you need these for deep learning?

* Lots of math T / F
* Lots of data T / F
* Lots of expensive computers T / F
* A PhD T / F

Answer: F, F, F, F

### 2. Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.

Answer: Natural language processing (NLP), Computer vision, Medicine, Biology.

Just for your FYI, here is are more areas:

* Natural language processing (NLP):: Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles mentioning a concept
* Computer vision:: Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience); face recognition; image captioning; reading traffic signs; locating pedestrians and vehicles in autonomous vehicles
* Medicine:: Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images; counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diagnosing diabetic retinopathy
* Biology:: Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions
* Image generation:: Colorizing images; increasing image resolution; removing noise from images; converting images to art in the style of famous artists
* Recommendation systems:: Web search; product recommendations; home page layout
* Playing games:: Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games
* Robotics:: Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking texture) or hard to pick up
* Other applications:: Financial and logistical forecasting, text to speech, and much more...

## 3. What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?
[The Mark I Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron)


## 4. Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?

Answer:

* A set of processing units
* A state of activation
* An output function for each unit
* A pattern of connectivity among units
* A propagation rule for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities
* An activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit
* A learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience
* An environment within which the system must operate
