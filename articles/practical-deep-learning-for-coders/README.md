# Practical Deep Learning for Coders (online course. cost: 5 days)

Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD - crash course (5 days)

.What you don't need to do deep learning

| Myth (don't need) | Truth
| Lots of math | Just high school math is sufficient
| Lots of data | We've seen record-breaking results with <50 items of data
| Lots of expensive computers | You can get what you need for state of the art work for free

## 1. Do you need these for deep learning?

* Lots of math T / F
* Lots of data T / F
* Lots of expensive computers T / F
* A PhD T / F

Answer: F, F, F, F

## 2. Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.

Answer: Natural language processing (NLP), Computer vision, Medicine, Biology.

Just for your FYI, here is are more areas:

* Natural language processing (NLP):: Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles mentioning a concept
* Computer vision:: Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience); face recognition; image captioning; reading traffic signs; locating pedestrians and vehicles in autonomous vehicles
* Medicine:: Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images; counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diagnosing diabetic retinopathy
* Biology:: Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions
* Image generation:: Colorizing images; increasing image resolution; removing noise from images; converting images to art in the style of famous artists
 * Recommendation systems:: Web search; product recommendations; home page layout
 * Playing games:: Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games
* Robotics:: Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking texture) or hard to pick up
* Other applications:: Financial and logistical forecasting, text to speech, and much more...
