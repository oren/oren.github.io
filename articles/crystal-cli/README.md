# Build CLI in Crystal

This CLI is a todo list in the terminal.

Download the code
```
git clone https://git.sceptique.eu/Sceptique/todo
make
```

Congrats! Now you have an executable file called todo. Try it:
```
./todo "buy milk"
./todo
./todo --remove 0
./todo "schedule dentist appointment" --date 4/13/20 --list work
./todo --list work
```

The code is in src folder. Make small change and run `make` again.
