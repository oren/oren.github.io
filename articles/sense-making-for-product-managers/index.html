<h1>Sense making for product managers</h1>

<p><img src="cynefin.jpg" alt="cynefin framework" /></p>

<p>Cynefin is a framework for making sense of different situations, depending on how predictable or unpredictable they are. Wardley Mapping is a method for developing strategy, depending on the maturity and visibility of the components involved. There are some obvious commonalities between them, and both are helpful for making decisions - but what is it that makes them different? And what can we do differently by looking at them together?</p>

<h2>Objective 1:</h2>

<p>Everyone on the team understand sense-making and system thinking and can describe the 4 domains above.</p>

<h2>Objective 2:</h2>

<p>Folks who have tools to deal with complexity (multiple experiments, bottom-up strategies) are leading complex challenges as Amazon single threaded owners (STO).</p>

<h2>Test: assess Martin vs John</h2>

<p>Which of them considers software systems as complex and which one considers it complicated?</p>

<p>Martin:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;If you have to spend effort into looking at a fragment of code to figure out what it&rsquo;s doing, then you should extract it into a function and name the function after that &lsquo;what&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to issue any mandates, but I want everyone to seriously consider some of these issues.</p>

<p>If a function is only called from a single place, consider inlining it.</p>

<p>If a function is called from multiple places, see if it is possible to arrange for the work to be done in a single place, perhaps with flags, and inline that.</p>

<p>If there are multiple versions of a function, consider making a single function with more, possibly defaulted, parameters.</p>

<p>If the work is close to purely functional, with few references to global state, try to make it completely functional.</p>

<p>Try to use const on both parameters and functions when the function really must be used in multiple places.</p>

<p>Minimize control flow complexity and &ldquo;area under ifs&rdquo;, favoring consistent execution paths and times over &ldquo;optimally&rdquo; avoiding unnecessary work.</p>

<p>To make things more complicated, the &lsquo;do always, then inhibit or ignore&rsquo; strategy, while a very good idea for high reliability systems, is less appropriate in power and thermal constrained environments like mobile.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>John&rsquo;s looks at software systems as a complex challenge while Martin see them as complicated.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>

<p>Write it down: How would you find quickly if someone has the tools to deal with a complex challenge? Can you use Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)? Does J represent complicated and P complex?</p>
