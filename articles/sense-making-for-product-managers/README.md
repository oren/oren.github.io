# Sense making for product managers

![cynefin framework](cynefin.jpg)

Cynefin is a framework for making sense of different situations, depending on how predictable or unpredictable they are. Wardley Mapping is a method for developing strategy, depending on the maturity and visibility of the components involved. There are some obvious commonalities between them, and both are helpful for making decisions - but what is it that makes them different? And what can we do differently by looking at them together?

## Objective 1:
Everyone on the team understand sense-making and system thinking and can describe the 4 domains above.

## Objective 2:
Folks who have tools to deal with complexity (multiple experiments, bottom-up strategies) are leading complex challenges as Amazon single threaded owners (STO).

## Test: assess Martin vs John

Which of them considers software systems as complex and which one considers it complicated?

Martin:
> "If you have to spend effort into looking at a fragment of code to figure out what it's doing, then you should extract it into a function and name the function after that 'what'."

John:
>"I'm not going to issue any mandates, but I want everyone to seriously consider some of these issues.

>If a function is only called from a single place, consider inlining it.

>If a function is called from multiple places, see if it is possible to arrange for the work to be done in a single place, perhaps with flags, and inline that.

>If there are multiple versions of a function, consider making a single function with more, possibly defaulted, parameters.

>If the work is close to purely functional, with few references to global state, try to make it completely functional.

>Try to use const on both parameters and functions when the function really must be used in multiple places.

>Minimize control flow complexity and "area under ifs", favoring consistent execution paths and times over "optimally" avoiding unnecessary work.

>To make things more complicated, the 'do always, then inhibit or ignore' strategy, while a very good idea for high reliability systems, is less appropriate in power and thermal constrained environments like mobile."

John's looks at software systems as a complex challenge while Martin see them as complicated.

## Reflection
Write it down: How would you find quickly if someone has the tools to deal with a complex challenge? Can you use Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)? Does J represent complicated and P complex?

## Cynefin Dynamics
* Innovation cycle. Example: Pokemon Go. This lead to innovations like Pokemon Go.
* Shallow dive into choas.
* Small precentage of things stablize.
* Chaos grazing.
