# ZeroNet

[ZeroNet](http://zeronet.io/) is a new platform for distributing websites. It was created by Tamas Kocsis from Hungary and was announced at the Decentralized Web Summit in San Francisco. IT uses Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent network to store any website on multiple peers.

Here is a five minutes demo of me playing with it:
