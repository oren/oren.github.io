# AI vs Humans - 人工智能

![ai](ai.jpg)

I recently [gave a talk](https://oren.github.io/talks/ai-healthcare.html) about the potential impact that AI will have on the healthcare industry.

As a preparations for the talk I reached out to the team behind my favorite Alexa skill - [Chineasy](https://www.chineasy.com/), and asked them to be a guest on their show. We recorded two episodes for about 40 minutes which are condensed into 7 minutes each. The first one about AI and the second is about the biggest problems humanity faces.

You can listen to the [AI episode](https://www.chineasy.com/talk/lessons/314-human/) here. The other one will be published soon and you can listen to it from any Alexa enabled device by saying `"Alexa, install Chineasy"`.
