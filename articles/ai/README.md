![ai](ai.jpg)

I was a guest at Chineasy podcast. ShaoLan Hsuehhl, the podcast host, asked me about being human and about the biggest promlems humanity faces. Here is the [Human](https://www.chineasy.com/talk/lessons/314-human/) episode and the [To Solve](https://www.chineasy.com/talk/lessons/332-to-solve/) episode. I also gave a [the talk](https://oren.github.io/talks/ai-healthcare/) in LA about the potential impact that AI will have on the healthcare industry.

Let me know what you think about any of the topics!
