# How to change a complex organization

This page is a crash course in [Agendashift](https://www.agendashift.com/).

Team of 6 will spend minimum of 7 hours to go through the entire Agendashift process.

* Discovery: 2-4 hours
* Exploration 2-3
* Mapping: 1-3 at the lower end if you do only 1 exercise
* Elaboration 1 hourâ€™s enough for each group to work on 1 item
* Operation: as long as you have. minumiu


Notes:
* You can skip the discovery and come back later if needed.
* Even the first two activities (Discovery and Exploration) end with actionable ideas.
* With a 6 person team (leadership team, or delivery team?) you likely don't have the multiple levels of hierarchy to get best value from the strategic thinking tools of the later chapters.
