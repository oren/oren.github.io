	<h1>How to change a complex organization</h1>
<p>This page is a crash course in <a href="https://www.agendashift.com/">Agendashift</a>.</p>
<p>Organization of 6 will spend minimum of 7 hours to go through the entire Agendashift process.</p>
<ol>
<li>Discovery: 2-4 hours</li>
<li>Exploration 2-3</li>
<li>Mapping: 1-3 at the lower end if you do only 1 exercise</li>
<li>Elaboration 1 hourâ€™s enough for each group to work on 1 item</li>
<li>Operation: as long as you have. minumiu</li>
</ol>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<h3>Quetsion 1</h3>
<p><strong>Regarding choosing between Discovery and Exploration, you can choose just one, but which?</strong></p>
<p>The activities of Exploration, based around the delivery survey debrief just don't really work for a brand new team, so do Discovery. For a newly formed team, then Discovery activity and in particular the Celebration exercise is a great way for people to really share their different ambitions for their work. (It's also good for a long running effort in an organisation too). What's a new team? A few months history working together would be plenty, but if they've only been together a few weeks or not yet delivered anything then the delivery survey quesions can't really make sense.</p>
<p>Do one or both of those activities, and then sign a 6 month+ contract to do operation, supported by the remaining activities.</p>
<h3>Quetsion 2</h3>
<p><strong>How long will an org of 100, 20 2-pizza team to go through the entire Agendashift process?</strong></p>
<p>(TODO: calculate this)</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Even the first two activities (Discovery and Exploration) end with actionable ideas.</li>
<li>With a 6 person team (leadership team, or delivery team?) you likely don't have the multiple levels of hierarchy to get best value from the strategic thinking tools of the later chapters.</li>
</ul>
