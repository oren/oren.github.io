Having a secure attachment style puts you in a good position to support your partner who has an anxious attachment style. Here are some ways you can help her:

1. **Communicate openly and honestly:** Encourage open communication in your relationship. Let your partner know that she can come to you with her concerns and that you'll listen without judgment. Be honest with her about your feelings and thoughts, as this can help build trust and security in the relationship.
1. **Provide reassurance:** People with anxious attachment styles often seek reassurance from their partners. Offer verbal affirmations of your love and commitment regularly. Let her know that you're there for her and that you care about her well-being.
1. **Set boundaries:** While it's important to be supportive, it's also crucial to set boundaries to maintain your own well-being. Let your partner know what behaviors are acceptable to you and what aren't. This can help prevent any codependent dynamics from forming in the relationship.
1. **Encourage her to seek therapy:** If your partner's anxiety is significantly impacting her life and your relationship, encourage her to seek therapy. A therapist can provide her with tools and strategies to manage her anxiety and work through any underlying issues contributing to her attachment style.
1. **Practice patience and empathy:** Understand that your partner's anxiety is not a reflection of you or your relationship. Practice patience and empathy when she's feeling anxious, and try to understand things from her perspective.
1. **Be mindful of triggers:** Pay attention to things that trigger your partner's anxiety and try to avoid or mitigate them when possible. This could include certain topics of conversation, situations, or behaviors.
1. **Work on building her self-esteem:** Anxious attachment often stems from low self-esteem and fear of abandonment. Help build your partner's self-esteem by offering genuine compliments, supporting her goals and interests, and reminding her of her strengths.

By implementing these strategies, you can support your partner with an anxious attachment style and help strengthen your relationship. Remember, building secure attachment takes time and effort from both partners, so be patient and compassionate as you navigate this journey together.
