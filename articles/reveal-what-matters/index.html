<h1>Reveal What Matters</h1>

<h2>1. The Opportunity</h2>

<p>As a leader of a large organization, you know that strategies coming from team members themselves are more likely to be embraced .  How do you encourage team members to come up with successful strategies?</p>

<h2>2. The Solution</h2>

<p>Encourage the team to set up an one hour meeting with no managers to discuss the most important topics. The outcome of the meeting is a list of insights and action items.</p>

<h2>3. How?</h2>

<p>Ask a team member to volunteer to facilitate the meeting by using the <a href="https://hohmannchris.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/what-is-lean-coffee/">Lean Coffee</a> technique. Ask the facilitator to invite all non-managers in the organization (as optional) to the meeting and ask them to present you the insights/action items from the meeting without revealing who said what. You want to focus on the ideas that came out of the meeting and not on the individuals.</p>
