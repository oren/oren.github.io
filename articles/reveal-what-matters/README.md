# Reveal What Matters

## 1. The Opportunity
As a leader of a large organization, you know that strategies coming from team members themselves are more likely to be embraced .  How do you encourage team members to come up with successful strategies?

## 2. The Solution
Encourage the team to set up an one hour meeting with no managers to discuss the most important topics. The outcome of the meeting is a list of insights and action items.

## 3. How?
Ask a team member to volunteer to facilitate the meeting by using the [Lean Coffee](https://hohmannchris.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/what-is-lean-coffee/) technique. Ask the facilitator to invite all non-managers in the organization (as optional) to the meeting and ask them to present you the insights/action items from the meeting without revealing who said what. You want to focus on the ideas that came out of the meeting and not on the individuals.
