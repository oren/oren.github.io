	<h1>How to Lead Leaders</h1>
<p>(This is a summary of the article <a href="https://medium.com/flatiron-engineering/abstract-management-interfaces-7bf70431450">Abstract Management Interfaces</a>)</p>
<h2>1. Challenge</h2>
<p>Your organization is growing and you have multiple organizations/teams. How to ensure each team is successful and is aligned with the parent organization?</p>
<h2>2. Solution</h2>
<p>Create autonomous teams. Each team owns each strategy, structure, and resources while maintaining alignment with the organization.</p>
<h2>3. How?</h2>
<p>Set two types of recurring meetings. One with each team lead and one with your manager.</p>
<h3>3.1 Review with your team lead</h3>
<p>Internal Interface</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineers know what’s most important to work on</li>
<li>Engineers know why the work they're doing is valuable/important</li>
<li>Engineers know what done looks like</li>
<li>Engineers have personal growth paths/plans</li>
<li>Team is happy</li>
<li>Team has a process to prioritize work (both features &amp; tech debt)</li>
<li>Team knows its stakeholders and what their needs are</li>
<li>Team consistently strives to improve its processes and interactions</li>
<li>Long term delivery plans are aligned with business needs</li>
</ul>
<p>External Interface</p>

<li>Long term delivery plans are aligned with business needs</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.2 Review with your manager</h3>

<li>Engineering output velocity does not decrease with age of products</li>
<li>Cross-team dependencies (inbound &amp; outbound) are tracked and resolved efficiently</li>
<li>There are plans in place for eventually removing “toil tasks”</li>
</ul>
<p>Alignment to company values</p>
