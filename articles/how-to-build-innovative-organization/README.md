# How to build an innovating organization
Below is a document that describe a company that builds a software product used by the nurses to reduce their load and improve patient outcomes.

## Chapter 1: mission
We reduce load of nurses in a hosiptal from ration of 1:10 to 1:20 and increase health of patients by extending the average life span in 5 years.

## Chapter 2: vision
Hospitals are so cheap to operate that every community enjoys affordable healthcare.

## Chapter 3: operating principles
* Every team member understand the business priorities and prioritize ruthlessly.
* Focus on 'job to be done' and not on level and role. Treat employees as unique people with special talents rather than replaceable lego blocks at generic ladder levels. Expect and incentivize each employee to do their unique best, rather than restrict them to the low-bar average expectation for their level.
* No one size fits all. Decide which (few!) products need legal review and let the others run faster.
* Experiment with bottom-up strategies by collecting data points from those who are closer to the customer.
* Connect VPs to the customer. VPs should conduct direct customer support themselves.
* Increase speed you create, deliver, and replace strategies. Increase manager fanout and decrease the depth of the organizational hierarchy.
