<h1>How to build an innovating organization</h1>

<p>This document describes a company that builds a software product used by air traffic controllers to reduce their workload.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: mission</h2>

<p>We reduce the workload of air traffic controllers. An airport will only need 5 traffic controllers when 100 aircrafts land in hour instead of current average of 10.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: vision</h2>

<p>TODO:</p>

<h2>Chapter 3: operating principles</h2>

<ol>
<li>Every team member understand the business priorities and prioritize ruthlessly.</li>
<li>Focus on &lsquo;job to be done&rsquo; and not on level and role. Treat employees as unique people with special talents rather than replaceable lego blocks at generic ladder levels. Expect and incentivize each employee to do their unique best, rather than restrict them to the low-bar average expectation for their level.</li>
<li>No one size fits all. Decide which (few!) products need legal review and let the others run faster.</li>
<li>Experiment with bottom-up strategies by collecting data points from those who are closer to the customer.</li>
<li>Connect VPs to the customer. VPs should conduct direct customer support themselves.</li>
<li>Increase speed you create, deliver, and replace strategies. Increase manager fanout and decrease the depth of the organizational hierarchy.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Chapter 4: levers</h2>

<p>TODO: add the levers of the company.</p>

<ol>
<li>Mindset/Paradigm: We have expertise in the healthcare industry, machine learning, cloud technology, software architecture, and design.</li>
<li>Goals: Increase the productivity of air traffic controler.</li>
<li>Structure: Product and engineering under a single leader.</li>
<li>Policies:</li>
<li>Mechanism:</li>
<li>Information flow:</li>
<li>Things we measure:</li>
<li>Resources:</li>
</ol>

<h2>Chapter 5: strategy</h2>

<p>TODO: add the strategy of the company.</p>

<ul>
<li>Challenge (diagnosis):</li>
<li>Guiding policies:</li>
<li>Actions:</li>
<li>Super Power:</li>
</ul>
