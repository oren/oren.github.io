<h1>How to Build Exceptional Relationships</h1>

<p>This is a summary of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Connect-Building-Exceptional-Relationships-Colleagues/dp/0593237099">Connect: Building Exceptional Relationships with Family, Friends, and Colleagues</a>.</p>

<p>An exceptional relationship is when someone really knows what&rsquo;s inside you. You feel seen, known, and appreciated for who you really are and not an edited version of yourself.  The book breaks it down to two domains: self disclosure and feedback.</p>

<p>Self disclosure:
* You can be fully yourself and so does the other person
* Both of you can be vulnerable
* You trust that self disclosure will not be used against you</p>

<p>Feedback and conflict:
*	You can be honest with each other
*	You deal with conflict productively
*	Both of you are committed to each other growth and development</p>

<h2>Connection Assesment</h2>

<p>The following are behaviors that impact our ability to build strong relationships. Select 5 that you believe are your strengths. Then review the list again and mark the 5 that are more difficult for you.  Send this list to a friend and ask them to asses you. Discuss the differences between what both of you wrote.</p>

<ol>
<li>Disclose personal issues that are important to you and your relationship.</li>
<li>Value your emotions, don’t downplay them, or feel the need to justify them or brush them aside.</li>
<li>Know how to express your emotions in an appropriate way.</li>
<li>Willing to be vulnerable (including expressing feelings of hurt, rejection and being one-down).</li>
<li>Ask for help when needed.</li>
<li>Make it easy for others to disclose what is important and personal for them.</li>
<li>React to others emotional disclosures in ways that invite further disclosure.</li>
<li>Actively listen; suspend judgement.</li>
<li>Engage in difficult exchanges with curiosity.</li>
<li>Show genuine interest and empathy when others share personal issues.</li>
<li>Hold back from giving advice and trying to solve their situation.</li>
<li>Ask open-ended questions so that the other can explore their own issues.</li>
<li>Refrain from trying to dominate; instead focus on working collaboratively.</li>
<li>Raise annoyances rather than shoving them under the rug where they can grow and fester.</li>
<li>Express your annoyance without blaming the other.</li>
<li>Avoid using humor as &ldquo;zingers&rdquo; or a way to &ldquo;make points&rdquo; indirectly.</li>
<li>Use humor to connect with the other and bring them closer.</li>
<li>Provide feedback that focuses on behavior and its impact on you, instead of making an attribution of the other’s motives, intentions or character.</li>
<li>Show appreciation/express gratitude to others for what they do or say.</li>
<li>Demonstrate receptiveness to critical feedback by keeping defensiveness down and not making excuses.</li>
<li>Respond to other’s defensiveness with curiosity and empathy.</li>
<li>Treat feedback, whether given or received, as information, not a demand for change.</li>
<li>Try to understand what is going on with the other, especially the other’s position when different than yours during arguments.</li>
<li>Recognize what hooks you (sets you off) and, when necessary,   set it aside temporarily to deal with the main issues.</li>
<li>See feedback as a gift - to give and receive.</li>
<li>Be receptive to conflict instead of avoiding it and see it as likely to contain information important to your development and growth of the relationship.</li>
<li>Believe that the objective during a disagreement is not to win but rather to seek a resolution that meets both of your needs and strengthens the relationship.</li>
<li>Willing to apologize and say &ldquo;I’m sorry&rdquo; when appropriate.</li>
<li>Pay attention to any needs for repair after a conflict in which the relationship has been strained.</li>
<li>Understand what is needed when repairing a relationship.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Japanese art form</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi">Kintsugi / kintsukuroi / golden repair</a>: repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum. As a philosophy, it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.</p>
