<h1>Challenges at Google</h1>

<p>AppSheet co-founder, Praveen Seshadri, left Google after 3 years. His startup was acquired by Google Cloud in 2020. He <a href="https://medium.com/@pravse/the-maze-is-in-the-mouse-980c57cfd61a">wrote a medium article</a> and describes the issues he observed at Google.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The way I see it, Google has four core cultural problems. They are all the natural consequences of having a money-printing machine called “Ads” that has kept growing relentlessly every year, hiding all other sins. (1) no mission, (2) no urgency, (3) delusions of exceptionalism, (4) mismanagement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>My key points:</h2>

<p><strong>Focus on &lsquo;job to be done&rsquo; and not on level and role.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Treat employees as unique people with special talents rather than replaceable lego blocks at generic ladder levels. Expect and incentivize each employee to do their unique best, rather than restrict them to the low-bar average expectation for their level.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>No &lsquo;one size fits all.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Decide which (few!) products need legal review and let the others run faster&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Experiment with bottom-up strategies by collecting data points from those who are closer to the customer</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Build some things that the customers wanted vs only what the VP wanted.&rdquo;
&ldquo;decisions are made by people with roles or titles rather than people with expertise.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Connect VPs to the customer.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;VPs should conduct direct customer support themselves&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Increase speed you create, deliver, and replace strategies.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;increase manager fanout and decrease the depth of the organizational hierarchy&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Measure the wrong thing hides real issues.</strong></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yay, time-to-first answer was less than 30 minutes so customer success dashboard is all green!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Learn from technology and processes that are outside of your company.</strong></p>
