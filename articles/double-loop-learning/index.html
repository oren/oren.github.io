<h1>Double-Loop Learning</h1>

<p><img src="double-loop-learning.jpg" alt="double loop learning" /></p>

<p>Double-loop learning is a way to increase innovation at a team or an orgaization. You can also apply it on your own processes or on your relationships. If you use double-loop learning, you will not only adapt to change but you will also be able to anticipate it.</p>

<p>What is a double-loop learning? At a high level it&rsquo;s a process that have 2 feedback loops: one for changing the process itself and another one for changing the mindset and goal of the process. By mindset I mean the assumptions that lead to the creation of this process. By goals I mean the objective/s of this process.</p>

<h2>How to build a process with double-loop learning?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s skip the theory and jump into action.</p>

<ol>
<li>Write down existing or new process you are part of at work.</li>
<li>Write down the input for this process.</li>
<li>Write down the output for this process.</li>
<li>Write down the first feedback loop.</li>
<li>Write down the second feedback loop.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll add an example soon.</p>
