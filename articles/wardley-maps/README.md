# Wardley Maps

## 1. What are Wardley Maps?

The process of making strategic decisions (leadership) based on the purpose (“the game”), a description of the competitive landscape (a map), the external forces acting on the landscape (climate), and the training of your people (doctrine).

Looping through the strategy cycle ([OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop)):

## 2. What Can You Do with Wardely Maps?

### Decide Between Outsuorcing and Building Your Own

Without the x and the y (a map), it's hard to tell what to do with A and B:

With a map, it make sense to outsource A and build B:

There is much more you can do with them. I'll add more examples soon.
### Where to Invest?

Compute (renting compute from a public cloud vendor) and platform (deploy tools and programming languages) are moving toward commodization. Should you build a compute or platform (genesis/chaotic) or wait until you can buy from a vendor (commodity/simple)? Generate experimental strategies, debate their impact with the team and test your assumptions as fast as possible.

## 3. How to Start with Wardley Maps?
Pick a user and write down one of their needs. Than write down what capabilities are required to achieve that need.

Example of a map. You are the user and your need is to be successful at work:
