This book is in a [website format](https://medium.com/wardleymaps/on-being-lost-2ef5f05eb1ec), [audio format](https://feststelltaste.github.io/wardley-maps-audiobook/), and a [pdf format](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HiredThought/wardley-maps-ebook/main/bin/Wardley%20Maps%20-%20Simon%20Wardley.pdf). I suggest to listen and read at the same time since there are various visuals in the pdf.
