<h1>Wardley Maps</h1>
<h2>1. What are Wardley Maps?</h2>
<p>The process of making strategic decisions (leadership) based on the purpose (“the game”), a description of the competitive landscape (a map), the external forces acting on the landscape (climate), and the training of your people (doctrine).</p>

<h2>2. What Can You Do with Wardely Maps?</h2>
<h3>Decide Between Outsuorcing and Building Your Own</h3>
<p>Without the x and the y (a map), it's hard to tell what to do with A and B:

<p>With a map, it make sense to outsource A and build B:

<p>There is much more you can do with them. I'll add more examples soon.</p>
<h3>Where to Invest?</h3>
<p>Compute (renting compute from a public cloud vendor) and platform (deploy tools and programming languages) are moving toward commodization. Should you build a compute or platform (genesis/chaotic) or wait until you can buy from a vendor (commodity/simple)? Generate experimental strategies, debate their impact with the team and test your assumptions as fast as possible.

<h2>3. How to Start with Wardley Maps?</h2>
<p>Pick a user and write down one of their needs. Than write down what capabilities are required to achieve that need.</p>
