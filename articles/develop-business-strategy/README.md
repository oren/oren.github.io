# How to Develop a Business Strategy

Many times, the strategic direction of our organization is emergent and can't be set. Strategy is changing our fit with the environment to our advantage by concentrating power in time.  I watched a [40 minutes talk](https://stream.syscoi.com/2019/07/17/patterns-of-strategy-hoverstadt-and-loh/) by Patrick Hoverstadt and Lucy Loh that explains how to leverage emergent strategy for your advantage. I plan to summarize it here in the next few days. Until I do that, please watch it.

At the end of this talk you will learn:
* How strategy emerges
* What are the forces that drive strategic direction (fit, time, and power).
* How you to cope and use those forces to your advantage using the Patterns of Strategy approach
