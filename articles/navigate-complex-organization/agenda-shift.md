This page is a crash course in [Agendashift](https://www.agendashift.com/).

Organization of 6 will spend minimum of 4.5 hours to go through the entire Agendashift process.

1. Discovery: 1.5-4 hours
1. Exploration 1.5-3
1. Mapping: 1-3 at the lower end if you do only 1 exercise
1. Elaboration 1 hourâ€™s enough for each group to work on 1 item
1. Operation: 1 hour minimum but use more time if you can

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### Quetsion 1
**Regarding choosing between Discovery and Exploration, you can choose just one, but which?**

The activities of Exploration, based around the delivery survey debrief just don't really work for a brand new team, so do Discovery. For a newly formed team, then Discovery activity and in particular the Celebration exercise is a great way for people to really share their different ambitions for their work. (It's also good for a long running effort in an organisation too). What's a new team? A few months history working together would be plenty, but if they've only been together a few weeks or not yet delivered anything then the delivery survey quesions can't really make sense.

Do one or both of those activities, and then sign a 6 month+ contract to do operation, supported by the remaining activities.

### Quetsion 2
**How long will an org of 100, 20 2-pizza team to go through the entire Agendashift process?**

 (TODO: calculate this)

## Notes

* Even the first two activities (Discovery and Exploration) end with actionable ideas.
* With a 6 person team (leadership team, or delivery team?) you likely don't have the multiple levels of hierarchy to get best value from the strategic thinking tools of the later chapters.
