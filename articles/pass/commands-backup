## Generate a gpg key
```
gpg2 --full-gen-key
```
Explanation: the pass application uses gpg keys to encrypt your passwords

## Initialize pass
```
pass init my-email@gmail.com
```
Explanation: the `init` command creates the folder where your passwords will be encrypted and stored - `~/.password-store`

## Setup git
```
sudo apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server
git init --bare ~/pass-repo
pass git init
pass git remote add origin ssh://oren@localhost:/home/oren/pass-repo
pass git push origin master
```
Explanation: these commands create a git repository that stores the encrypted passwords. The repository is located at `~/pass-repo` and is needed in order to allow your phone to pull and push passwords.

## Generate a set of OpenSSH keys
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/msfjarvis/.ssh/id_rsa): pass_store
```
Explanation: this command create two files: pass_store and pass_store.pub. Those are SSH keys that allow your phone to authenticate with your laptop

## Copy the public SSH key to authorized_keys
```
cat pass_store.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Explanation: adding the public ssh key to the authorized_keys file will allow your phone (which will have the private key) to authenticate with your laptop

## Setup your phone related stuff
* Enable USB Debugging on your phone (google for it. It depends on your Android)
* Connect a USB cable from your phone to your laptop
* Pick 'Transfer files' on the phone

## Copy the SSH key to your phone
```
sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb
adb push pass_store /sdcard/
adb shell chmod 644 /sdcard/pass_store
```
Explanation: you copied the private SSH key to your phone. /sdcard/ on Android is a symlink to internal storage so you can push to it without needing to poke into /mnt

## Use the SSH key in the Password Store app
* Open the Password Store app on your phone
* Click on the three dots at the top right -> Settings -> Import SSH key
* Click on the three dots at the top right -> Show internal storage -> Click on the three horizontal lines on the top left -> Click on your phones icon
* Find the pass_store file and click it. Notice the message: 'SSH file imported'

Remove the key from your phone
```
adb shell rm /sdcard/pass_store
```

## Connect the Password Store app to the git repository on your laptop
* Open the Password Store app on your phone
* Click on the three dots at the top right -> Settings -> 'Edit git server settings'

Fill-in the server info:
```
Username: my laptop's user
Server URL: my laptop's url
repo path: pass-repo
```

* Click  'SAVE'
* Click the left arrow at the top left
* Click on the three dots at the top right -> 'pull from remote'

I see the following message:
```
An error occured during a Git operation.

`g ``

Note: xxx is the last commit in ~/pass-repo

* Click on the three dots at the top right -> 'Synchronize repository'

I see the following message:
