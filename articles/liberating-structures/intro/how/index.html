<h1>Introduction to Liberating Structures</h1>
<p><strong>Challange</strong>: demonstrate to technical leaders the value of a bottom-up mecahnism that requires them to let go of control in order to increase innovation in their organization.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: practice the following LS structures: Rapidly Share Challenges and Expectations, Build New Connections (<a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking">Impromtu Networking</a>), Stop Counterproductive Activities and Behaviors to Make Space for Innovation (<a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/6-making-space-with-triz">TRIZ</a>), Together, Look Back on Progress to Date and Decide What Adjustments Are Neede (<a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w">What, So What, Now What?</a>)</p>
<h3>1. Impromtu Networking</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time: 20 mintues</li>
<li>3 sessions, each one 2 minutes with random pair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask participants to pair up for 2 minutes and ask each other the question: &quot;Tell me about a time where people left enegrgized, excited, and clear about what they should do&quot;. Pair 2 more times. Than bring everyone back to the main room for discussion.</li>
<li>Debried: what was liberating about it? what was structured about it?</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. TRIZ</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time: 20 minutes</li>
<li>3 sessions, each one 5 minutes with 4 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Session 1: write down in the shared doc answers to: &quot;think about how we could reliably design our online meeting so that nothing got done, everyone had a TERRIBLE time and our leadership and credibility is seriously damaged. Make a list of all the things you would have to do to make this happen. Go wild!&quot; After 5 minutes bring everyone back to the main room and observe the shared docs each group created. Ask for themes. What's standing out? &quot;which one of these do you see in your own meetings?&quot;</li>
<li>Session 2: write down in the shared doc answers to: &quot;Now run through each element. Which of these elements is currently present in your work practices&quot;. After 5 minutes bring everyone back to the main room and observe the shared docs each group created. Ask for themes. What's standing out?</li>
<li>Session 3: write down in the shared doc answers to: &quot;pick one or more of those things to STOP doing before you design your meetings. What is the first step you need to do to STOP it? Make a plan to do that. Be as concrete as you can and identify who has to be involved to make it happen. Be prepared to share your next steps&quot;</li>
<li>Debried: what was liberating about it? what was structured about it?</li>
<li>What's the value of TRIZ? help brainstorm in a way that is safe. Increase data points. diving deeper into data and generate more data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. What, so what? so what?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Time: 20 minutes</li>
<li>3 sessions, each one 3 minutes with 4 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Details:</p>
<ul>
<li>Session 1: write down in the shared doc answers to: &quot;What happened? What did you notice, what facts or observations stood out?&quot;. After 3 minutes bring everyone back to the main. Share insights from the shared docs.</li>
<li>Session 2: write down in the shared doc answers to: &quot;Why is that important? What patterns or conclusions are emerging? What hypotheses can I/we make?&quot;. After 3 minutes bring everyone back to the main. Share insights from the shared docs.</li>
<li>Session 3: write down in the shared doc answers to: &quot;Now what? What actions make sense?&quot;. After 3 minutes bring everyone back to the main. Share insights from the shared docs.</li>
<li>Debried: what was liberating about it? what was structured about it?</li>
</ul>
