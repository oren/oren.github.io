# Introduction to Liberating Structures

**Challange**: demonstrate to technical leaders the value of a bottom-up mecahnism that requires them to let go of control in order to increase innovation in their organization.

**Solution**: practice the following LS structures: Rapidly Share Challenges and Expectations, Build New Connections ([Impromtu Networking](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/2-impromptu-networking)), Stop Counterproductive Activities and Behaviors to Make Space for Innovation ([TRIZ](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/6-making-space-with-triz)), Together, Look Back on Progress to Date and Decide What Adjustments Are Neede ([What, So What, Now What?](http://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w))

### 1. Impromtu Networking
* Time: 20 mintues
* 3 sessions, each one 2 minutes with random pair.

Details:

* Ask participants to pair up for 2 minutes and ask each other the question: "Tell me about a time where people left enegrgized, excited, and clear about what they should do". Pair 2 more times. Than bring everyone back to the main room for discussion.

### 2. TRIZ
* Time: 20 minutes
* 3 sessions, each one 5 minutes with 4 people.

Details:

* Session 1: write down in the shared doc answers to: "think about how we could reliably design our online meeting so that nothing got done, everyone had a TERRIBLE time and our leadership and credibility is seriously damaged. Make a list of all the things you would have to do to make this happen. Go wild!" After 5 minutes bring everyone back to the main room and observe the shared docs each group created. Ask for themes. What's standing out? "which one of these do you see in your own meetings?"
* Session 2: write down in the shared doc answers to: "Now run through each element. Which of these elements is currently present in your work practices". After 5 minutes bring everyone back to the main room and observe the shared docs each group created. Ask for themes. What's standing out?
* Session 3: write down in the shared doc answers to: "pick one or more of those things to STOP doing before you design your meetings. What is the first step you need to do to STOP it? Make a plan to do that. Be as concrete as you can and identify who has to be involved to make it happen. Be prepared to share your next steps"

### 3. What, so what? so what?
* Time: 20 minutes
* 3 sessions, each one 3 minutes with 4 people.

Details:

* Session 1: write down in the shared doc answers to: "What happened? What did you notice, what facts or observations stood out?". After 3 minutes bring everyone back to the main. Share insights from the shared docs.
* Session 2: write down in the shared doc answers to: "Why is that important? What patterns or conclusions are emerging? What hypotheses can I/we make?". After 3 minutes bring everyone back to the main. Share insights from the shared docs.
* Session 3: write down in the shared doc answers to: "Now what? What actions make sense?". After 3 minutes bring everyone back to the main. Share insights from the shared docs.
* Debried: what was liberating about it? what was structured about it?
