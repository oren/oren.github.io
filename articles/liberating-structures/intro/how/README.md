# Introduction to Liberating Structures

**Challange**: demonstrate to technical leaders the value of a bottom-up mecahnism that requires them to let go of control in order to increase innovation in their organization.

**Solution**: string of 3 LS structures: Rapidly Share Challenges and Expectations (Impromtu Networking), Build New Connections, Stop Counterproductive Activities and Behaviors to Make Space for Innovation (TRIZ), Together, Look Back on Progress to Date and Decide What Adjustments Are Neede (What, So What, Now What?)

### 1. Impromtu Networking
* Ask participants to pair up for 2 minutes and ask each other the question: "Tell me about a time where people left enegrgized, excited, and clear about what they should do". Pair 2 more times.
* Debried: what was liberating about it? what was structured about it?

### 2. TRIZ
* Spend 1 minute individually and write down in the chat (after 3 minute) the following answer: "If we wanted to have the worst possible outcome from a meeting, what would we do?"
* In a group, ask for themes. what's standing out? "which one of these do you see in your own meetings?"
* Debried: what was liberating about it? what was structured about it?

What's the value of TRIZ? help brainstorm in a way that is safe. Increase data points. diving deeper into data and generate more data.

### 3. What, so what? so what?
**What?**
Write down individualy in 1 minute and output in the chat: "what's going on in your meeting that are keeping people from being exicited?", "look at the data, anything surprising?" don't judge.

**So What?**
Write down individualy in 1 minute and output in the chat: "take a minute to look through the data. what trends, meaning do you make out of the data?"

**Now What?**
* Write down individualy in 1 minute and output in the chat: "based on the meaning, what actions do you think we should take?"

Debried: what was liberating about it? what was structured about it?
