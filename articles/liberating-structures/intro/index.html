<h1>Introduction to Liberating Structures (LS)</h1>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ER5iCTY.jpg" alt="frameworks" /></p>
<h2>1. What is LS?</h2>
<p>LS are simple rules that make it possible to include and engage every voice in shaping the future. The LS repertoire consists of 33 practical methods versatile enough for anyone to use for a wide array of activities and challenges. None require expert training. Seeing them in action once is enough for many novices to get results and adapt them for use in other settings.</p>
<h2>2. What is the value of LS?</h2>
<p>LS offer easy methods for achieving better results in every situation; performance improvement is not a mundane or repetitive task provided you are willing to include as many of the affected people as possible (employees, customers, etc.). Problem solving, making decisions, planning, or innovating then become processes that you are facilitating rather than directing.</p>
<h2>3. What will you learn in this session?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Understand what is LS by practicing it.</li>
<li>Identify situations where you can use LS.</li>
<li>Learn where you can explore more about LS.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. About the session</h2>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: demonstrate to technical leaders the value of a bottom-up mecahnism that requires them to let go of control in order to increase innovation in their organization.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: practice the following LS structures: Rapidly Share Challenges and Expectations (Impromtu Networking), Build New Connections, Stop Counterproductive Activities and Behaviors to Make Space for Innovation (TRIZ), Together, Look Back on Progress to Date and Decide What Adjustments Are Neede (What, So What, Now What?)</p>
