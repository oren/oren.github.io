# Liberating Structures
This article is in work in progress state. I need to think about a clear way to explain it.

## 1. What is it?
Mechanism to increase productivity and innovation: find your goal, than create the meeting format that ensure that the team executes towards this goal.

## 2. Example:
My goal is to spread innovation by scaling out and up. I can setup a meeting that is broken down to the following styles: Nine Whys + Min Specs + Ecocycle + Panarchy

Details of various styles: Clarify how your work is justified to the larger community (purpose) with **Nine Whys** and specify the must dos and must not dos with **Min Specs**. With the **Ecocycle**, clarify the status of your portfolio of activities and relationships at the level of your organization. Use **Panarchy** to clarify activities and relationships at all the other levels that affect your initiative and identify opportunities for actions.
