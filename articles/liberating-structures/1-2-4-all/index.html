<h1>1-2-4-All</h1>

<h2>1. Why?</h2>

<p>What&rsquo;s the goal of 1-2-4-All?
* Engage every individual in searching for answers
* Create safe spaces for expression, diminish power differentials</p>

<h2>2. When?</h2>

<p>Use 1-2-4-All when you want to:
* generaget questions after a presentation
* A group of managers used two rounds of 1-2-4-All to redesign their less-than-stimulating weekly meeting.
* For a spontaneous conversation that starts after the topic of a meeting has been announced
* For a group that tends to be excessively influenced by its leader</p>

<h2>3. What?</h2>

<p>You can immediately include everyone regardless of how large the group is. You can generate better ideas and more of them faster than ever before. You can tap the know-how and imagination that is distributed widely in places not known in advance. Open, generative conversation unfolds. Ideas and solutions are sifted in rapid fashion. Most importantly, participants own the ideas, so follow-up and implementation is simplified. No buy-in strategies needed! Simple and elegant!</p>

<h2>4. How?</h2>

<p><strong>Before the session:</strong></p>

<p>Come up with a question that the group should answer. It depends on the context. Examples: &ldquo;What do you want to ask the speaker?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What opportunities do YOU see for making progress on this challenge?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What ideas or actions do you recommend?&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>At the session:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Individially - write the question on a card or paper. For example: &ldquo;What do you want to ask the speaker?&rdquo;</li>
<li>In pairs - Generate ideas in pairs, building on ideas from the previous step. 2 min.</li>
<li>In foursomes - Share and develop ideas from your pair in foursomes (notice similarities and differences). 4 min.</li>
<li>Ask, &ldquo;What is one idea that stood out in your conversation?&rdquo; Each group shares one important idea with all (repeat cycle as needed). 5 min.</li>
</ul>
