# Mechanism for revealing emergent strategies

## 1. Introduction (5 min)
Share with the group: "The desired outcomes of this 1 hour session is a list of ideal states and a list of obstacles in the way to get there. We will use 3 meeting structures: Impromptu Networking (20 min), 1-2-all (20 min), and W3 (15 min). If anyone is interested in Liberating Structures, go to https://oren.github.io/ls. This site doesn't exist yet so you can email orengolan@gmail.com and ask Oren to call you.

## 2. Impromptu Networking (20 min)
* **Why?** Rapidly share challenges and expectations while building new connections.
* **How:** Ask everyone: "have you ever worked in or heard of a team or organization that was innovative, fun, and meet the strategic needs of it's customers? what about it was so good? go wild! there are no bad ideas!". Randomize the group into pairs. Each pair spends 4 minutes together. One person asks the other the same question you just asked. The person who listens take notes on a shared document. After 2 minutes, change roles. Regroup and ask the group to vote for 2 ideas they like the best. Make sure the first few items from that list are clear to everyone.
* **Output:** A list of the top emergent visions and initiatives.

## 3. 1-2-all (20 min)
* **Why?** Engage everyone simultaneously in generating questions/ideas/suggestions.
* **How:** Ask everyone: "what obstacles we have to overcome to meet the first vision and first initiative from the list of visions and initiatives?". Ask each person to write it on their own notes. Pair randomly. Each pair spends 4 minutes together. One person asks the other one the same question. The listener write it down in the shared document. After 2 minutes switch roles. Regroup and ask the group to vote for 2 ideas they like the best. Make sure the first few items from that list are clear to everyone.
* **Output:** A list of the obstacles in the way of the desired visions or initiatives.

## 4. What, so what? now what? / W3 (15 min)
* **Why?** Together, look back on progress to-date and decide what adjustments are needed.
* **How?**
  * Session 1: "What happened? What did you notice, what facts or observations stood out?"
  * Session 2: "Why is that important? What patterns or conclusions are emerging? What hypotheses can I/we make?"
  * Session 3: "Now what? What actions make sense?".
* **Output:** action items or things that folks should look into.
