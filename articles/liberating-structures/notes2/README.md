# More Notes

There are a number of perspectives, frameworks, practices (like Liberating Structures) that spring from a similar set of discoveries or models (like complexity science).  They have lots of overlap, and it is easy to navigate through the "canopy" because the "forest" of applications are grounded in the same soil.
