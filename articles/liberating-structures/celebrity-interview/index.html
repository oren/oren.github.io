<h1>Celebrity Interview</h1>

<h2>1. Why?</h2>

<p>What&rsquo;s the goal of Celebrity Interview?
* Dive fast into the operating model of an expert
* Reveal and animate big concepts using stories</p>

<h2>2. When?</h2>

<p>Use Celebrity Interview when you want to:
* help launch a new initiative
* get to know a new expert and share their experience
* create a cast-study with deeper analysis</p>

<h2>3. What?</h2>

<p>You can enable a large group of people to connect with a leader or an expert (the celebrity) as a person and grasp the nuances of how that person is approaching a challenge. With a well-designed interview, you can turn what would otherwise be a passive, often boring presentation into a personal narrative that is entertaining, imparts valuable knowledge, and reveals the full range of rational, emotional, and ethical/moral dynamics at play. You can often turn the interview into an invitation to action, drawing out all the elements needed to spark the participant group’s imagination and encourage cohesive action.</p>

<h2>4. How?</h2>

<p><strong>Before the session:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Find an individual (the expert) that has something useful to share with the team.</li>
<li>Prepare a few questions to ask them. You can also ask some team members &ldquo;What is the most important thing you want to know about this person or the work ahead?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Do a dry run with the expert. You can use any interview style you want - fireside chat, Oprah, Stephen Colbert, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At the session:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Introduce the expert and topic to be discussed. 1 min</li>
<li>Ask questions. 10 min</li>
<li>Audience generates more questions on cards in a <a href="../1-2-4-all/">1-2-4 conversation</a>. 5-10 min</li>
<li>Collect cards, look for patterns, and ask the expert more questions. 5-10 min</li>
<li>Make closing coments, thank the expert</li>
</ul>
