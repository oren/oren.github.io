<h1>Celebrity Interview</h1>

<h2>1. Why?</h2>

<p>What&rsquo;s the goal of Celebrity Interview?
* Dive fast into the operating model of an expert
* Reveal and animate big concepts using stories</p>

<h2>2. When?</h2>

<p>Use Celebrity Interview when you want to:
* help launch a new initiative
* get to know a new expert and share their experience
* create a cast-study with deeper analysis</p>

<h2>3. What?</h2>

<p>You can enable a large group of people to connect with a leader or an expert (the celebrity) as a person and grasp the nuances of how that person is approaching a challenge. With a well-designed interview, you can turn what would otherwise be a passive, often boring presentation into a personal narrative that is entertaining, imparts valuable knowledge, and reveals the full range of rational, emotional, and ethical/moral dynamics at play. You can often turn the interview into an invitation to action, drawing out all the elements needed to spark the participant groupâ€™s imagination and encourage cohesive action.</p>

<h2>4. How?</h2>

<p><strong>Before the session:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Find an individual (the expert) that has something useful to share with the team.</li>
<li>Prepare a few questions to ask them. You can also ask some team members &ldquo;What is the most important thing you want to know about this person or the work ahead?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Do a dry run with the expert. You can use any interview style you want - fireside chat, Oprah, Stephen Colbert, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>At the session:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Introduce the expert and topic to be discussed. 1 min</li>
<li>Ask questions. 10 min</li>
<li>Audience generates more questions on cards in a <a href="../1-2-4-all/">1-2-4 conversation</a>. 5-10 min</li>
<li>Collect cards, look for patterns, and ask the expert more questions. 5-10 min</li>
<li>Make closing coments, thank the expert</li>
</ul>
