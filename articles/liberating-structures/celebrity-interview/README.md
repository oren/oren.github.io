# Celebrity Interview

## 1. Why?

What's the goal of Celebrity Interview?
* Dive fast into the operating model of an expert
* Reveal and animate big concepts using stories

## 2. When?

Use Celebrity Interview when you want to:
* help launch a new initiative
* get to know a new expert and share their experience
* create a cast-study with deeper analysis


## 3. What?
You can enable a large group of people to connect with a leader or an expert (the celebrity) as a person and grasp the nuances of how that person is approaching a challenge. With a well-designed interview, you can turn what would otherwise be a passive, often boring presentation into a personal narrative that is entertaining, imparts valuable knowledge, and reveals the full range of rational, emotional, and ethical/moral dynamics at play. You can often turn the interview into an invitation to action, drawing out all the elements needed to spark the participant groupâ€™s imagination and encourage cohesive action.

## 4. How?
**Before the session:**

* Find an individual (the expert) that has something useful to share with the team.
* Prepare a few questions to ask them. You can also ask some team members "What is the most important thing you want to know about this person or the work ahead?"
* Do a dry run with the expert. You can use any interview style you want - fireside chat, Oprah, Stephen Colbert, etc.

**At the session:**

* Introduce the expert and topic to be discussed. 1 min
* Ask questions. 10 min
* Audience generates more questions on cards in a [1-2-4 conversation](../1-2-4-all/). 5-10 min
* Collect cards, look for patterns, and ask the expert more questions. 5-10 min
* Make closing coments, thank the expert
