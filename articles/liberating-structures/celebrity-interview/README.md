# Celebrity Interview

## 1. Why?

What's the goal of Celebrity Interview?
* Dive fast into the operating model of an expert
* Reveal and animate big concepts using stories

## 2. When?

Use Celebrity Interview when you want to:
* help launch a new initiative
* get to know a new expert and share their experience

## 3. What?
You can enable a large group of people to connect with a leader or an expert (the celebrity) as a person and grasp the nuances of how that person is approaching a challenge. With a well-designed interview, you can turn what would otherwise be a passive, often boring presentation into a personal narrative that is entertaining, imparts valuable knowledge, and reveals the full range of rational, emotional, and ethical/moral dynamics at play. You can often turn the interview into an invitation to action, drawing out all the elements needed to spark the participant groupâ€™s imagination and encourage cohesive action.
