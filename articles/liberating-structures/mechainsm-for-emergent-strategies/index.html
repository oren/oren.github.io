<h1>Mechanism for revealing emergent strategies</h1>

<h2>1. Introduction (5 min)</h2>

<p>Share with the group: &ldquo;The desired outcomes of this 1 hour session is a list of ideal states and a list of obstacles in the way to get there. We will use 3 meeting structures: Impromptu Networking (20 min), 1-2-all (20 min), and W3 (15 min)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>If anyone is interested in Liberating Structures, go to <a href="https://oren.github.io/ls">https://oren.github.io/ls</a>. This site doesn&rsquo;t exist yet so you can email orengolan@gmail.com and Oren will share with you a 10 minutes crash course: <strong>How to use Liberating Structures?</strong>.</p>

<h2>2. Impromptu Networking (20 min)</h2>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Rapidly share challenges and expectations while building new connections.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>Ask everyone: &ldquo;have you ever worked in or heard of a team or organization that was innovative, fun, and meet the strategic needs of it&rsquo;s customers? what about it was so good? go wild! there are no bad ideas!&rdquo;. Randomize the group into pairs. Each pair spends 4 minutes together. One person asks the other the same question you just asked. The person who listens take notes on a shared document. After 2 minutes, change roles. Regroup and ask the group to vote for 2 ideas they like the best. Make sure the first few items from that list are clear to everyone.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A list of the top emergent visions and initiatives.</p>

<h2>3. 1-2-all (20 min)</h2>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Engage everyone simultaneously in generating questions/ideas/suggestions.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<p>Ask everyone: &ldquo;what obstacles we have to overcome to meet the first vision and first initiative from the list of visions and initiatives?&rdquo;. Ask each person to write it on their own notes. Pair randomly. Each pair spends 4 minutes together. One person asks the other one the same question. The listener write it down in the shared document. After 2 minutes switch roles. Regroup and ask the group to vote for 2 ideas they like the best. Make sure the first few items from that list are clear to everyone.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>A list of the obstacles in the way of the desired visions or initiatives.</p>

<h2>4. What, so what? now what? / W3 (15 min)</h2>

<h3>Why?</h3>

<p>Together, look back on progress to-date and decide what adjustments are needed.</p>

<h2>How?</h2>

<ul>
<li>Session 1: &ldquo;What happened? What did you notice, what facts or observations stood out?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Session 2: &ldquo;Why is that important? What patterns or conclusions are emerging? What hypotheses can I/we make?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Session 3: &ldquo;Now what? What actions make sense?&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Output</h3>
