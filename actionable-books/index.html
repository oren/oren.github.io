<h2 id="thinking-in-bets-making-smarter-decisions-when-you-dont-have-all-the-facts">Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts</h2>
<p>Notes: the author was a professional poker player. In the book, she generalizes successful poker strategies to life and business. "life is closer to poker than to chess".</p>
<ul>
<li>Think and express your believes on a range of certainty instead of true/false. This will allow you to adapt your believe when new information arrives. It will also invite others to collaborate because they know that your thinking is adaptable.</li>
<li>Build trust by (1) expressing uncertainty, and (2) start with things you agree with and follow with "and" and not with "but".</li>
<li>Improve decision making with the 10-10-10 process: before a decision, ask yourself “What are the consequences of each of my options in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years?”. This process might trigger feeling af regret, which the author calls "mental time travel".</li>
<li>If you want to achieve something, write down the outcomes first and than the dependencies/obstacles. The author calls it "Backcasting". This can reveal events or obstacles that are rare or hard to overcome and can lead you to develop strategies to address them.</li>
<li>In addition to writing down the positive outcomes, write down the negative ones. Studies shows that it will increase the chance your success because it will give you more perspective, empathy, and nuance of your challenge/goal.</li>
