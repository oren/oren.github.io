# Messed Up With Certifications

Eyal, my HEBREW friend, called me 'dafuk im teudot' which means I am an idiot. The literal translation is 'messed up with certifications'. He made his diagnosis after I refused to installed the Blind application on my phone since "I don't like to install anything". He also shared a beautiful Israeli song with that name. The singer is Eyal Golan, very famous singer and no, we are not related. I just realized that the name Eyal Golan is a hybrid between my friend and I. Wonderful.

You taught me everything

you didn't teach me how to get over you

passing with you every obstacle

but what do we do when we split up


Again get up and fall down

how large is the ego

you'll pay always the most

how to get out of this for the least

You are so learned

you don't listen to anyone else

in the end your always alone


You don't learn from your mistakes

your life is a hallucination

ascents and declines

this is a university

and how many questions

what we could have been

and you left within me such a large scratch

you're messed up with certifications


How much i wanted all to be good for you

remaining for always like children

i didn't want to leave in this way

i didn't learn yet how to get over you


And so take another Akemol1

and spread out on the beach

try again to repress

all that happened yesterday


How much do you love taking risks

and you'll be the best at it again

with someone else


You don't learn from your mistakes

your life is a hallucination

ascents and declines

this is a university

and how many questions

what we could have been

and you left within me such a large scratch

you're messed up with certifications
