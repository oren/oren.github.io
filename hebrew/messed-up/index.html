<h1>Messed Up With Certifications</h1>

<p>Eyal, my HEBREW friend, called me &lsquo;dafuk im teudot&rsquo; which means I am an idiot. The literal translation is &lsquo;messed up with certifications&rsquo;. He made his diagnosis after I refused to install the &lsquo;Blind&rsquo; application on my phone since &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to install anything&rdquo;. He also shared a beautiful Israeli song with that name. The singer is Eyal Golan, very famous singer and no, we are not related. I just realized that the name Eyal Golan is a hybrid between my friend and I. Wonderful.</p>

<p>You taught me everything</p>

<p>you didn&rsquo;t teach me how to get over you</p>

<p>passing with you every obstacle</p>

<p>but what do we do when we split up</p>

<p>Again get up and fall down</p>

<p>how large is the ego</p>

<p>you&rsquo;ll pay always the most</p>

<p>how to get out of this for the least</p>

<p>You are so learned</p>

<p>you don&rsquo;t listen to anyone else</p>

<p>in the end your always alone</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t learn from your mistakes</p>

<p>your life is a hallucination</p>

<p>ascents and declines</p>

<p>this is a university</p>

<p>and how many questions</p>

<p>what we could have been</p>

<p>and you left within me such a large scratch</p>

<p>you&rsquo;re messed up with certifications</p>

<p>How much i wanted all to be good for you</p>

<p>remaining for always like children</p>

<p>i didn&rsquo;t want to leave in this way</p>

<p>i didn&rsquo;t learn yet how to get over you</p>

<p>And so take another Akemol1</p>

<p>and spread out on the beach</p>

<p>try again to repress</p>

<p>all that happened yesterday</p>

<p>How much do you love taking risks</p>

<p>and you&rsquo;ll be the best at it again</p>

<p>with someone else</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t learn from your mistakes</p>

<p>your life is a hallucination</p>

<p>ascents and declines</p>

<p>this is a university</p>

<p>and how many questions</p>

<p>what we could have been</p>

<p>and you left within me such a large scratch</p>

<p>you&rsquo;re messed up with certifications</p>
