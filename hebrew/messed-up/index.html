	<h1>Messed Up With Certifications</h1>
<p>Eyal, my HEBREW friend, called me 'dafuk im teudot' which means I am an idiot. The literal translation is 'messed up with certifications'. He made his diagnosis after I refused to installed the Blind application on my phone since &quot;I don't like to install anything&quot;. He also shared a beautiful Israeli song with that name. The singer is Eyal Golan, very famous singer and no, we are not related. I just realized that the name Eyal Golan is a hybrid between my friend and I. Wonderful.</p>

<p>You taught me everything</p>
<p>you didn't teach me how to get over you</p>
<p>passing with you every obstacle</p>
<p>but what do we do when we split up</p>
<p>Again get up and fall down</p>
<p>how large is the ego</p>
<p>you'll pay always the most</p>
<p>how to get out of this for the least</p>
<p>You are so learned</p>
<p>you don't listen to anyone else</p>
<p>in the end your always alone</p>
<p>You don't learn from your mistakes</p>
<p>your life is a hallucination</p>
<p>ascents and declines</p>
<p>this is a university</p>
<p>and how many questions</p>
<p>what we could have been</p>
<p>and you left within me such a large scratch</p>
<p>you're messed up with certifications</p>
<p>How much i wanted all to be good for you</p>
<p>remaining for always like children</p>
<p>i didn't want to leave in this way</p>
<p>i didn't learn yet how to get over you</p>
<p>And so take another Akemol1</p>
<p>and spread out on the beach</p>
<p>try again to repress</p>
<p>all that happened yesterday</p>
<p>How much do you love taking risks</p>
<p>and you'll be the best at it again</p>
<p>with someone else</p>
<p>You don't learn from your mistakes</p>
<p>your life is a hallucination</p>
<p>ascents and declines</p>
<p>this is a university</p>
<p>and how many questions</p>
<p>what we could have been</p>
<p>and you left within me such a large scratch</p>
<p>you're messed up with certifications</p>
