Someone here remembered a little bit too late

And it wasn't me

This is not about myself

Something here came out a little bit nasty

And it wasn't me

This is not about myself

One down

It's a lot better to go home alone

It is not complicated

Just don't send me any texts tonight


Are you awake? Go to sleep!

Let's go out? In your dreams!

Are you sure? A million!

I sang all day.


Come and see what you missed

Come and see come and see

Come and see what you missed

Come and see come and see

Someone here got a little bit dirty

But not me

This is not about myself


And after all of that you think you are an angel

But not me

This is not about myself


One down

It's a lot better to go home alone

It is not complicated

Just don't send me any texts tonight


Are you awake? Go to sleep!

Let's go out? In your dreams!

Are you sure? A million!

I sang all day.


Come and see what you missed

Come and see come and see

Come and see what you missed

Come and see come and see

You are not going to see me bummed out

You won't see it you won't see it

Come and see what you missed

Come and see come and see


Just don't ask me to forgive you again

Really this is what it will take to be successful

Whatever happens I am still not yours

Wait a minute. What did you say? You have someone else?


Go to sleep

Let's go out? In your dreams!

Are you sure? A million!

I sang all day.


Come and see what you missed

Come and see come and see

Come and see what you missed

Come and see come and see

You are not going to see me bummed out

You won't see it you won't see it

Come and see what you missed

Come and see come and see
