My Mom

I have a woman that loves me,
She’s mine only.
She knows me from my beginning,
mine and hers.
She has no choice but to be smart,
My mom
And this song I sing for her –

Mom, mom,
You nursed me,
You pampered me,
You brought me,
You.

How many days I spent with her,
My mom.
How many tears I dried with her,
Mine and hers
How many things I discovered with her,
My mom
How many hopes we had together.

Mom, mom

You were always with me
Even when I was alone.
I will always be with you,
My mom.

There are times when I’m in trouble,
My mom.
You can read between the lines,
Mine and yours
Why do you worry and lose sleep,
My mom,
How is it that a mother doesn’t trust her son?

Mom, mom,
You nursed me,
You pampered me,
You brought me,
You.
