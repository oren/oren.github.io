# Tutorial 2 - Syntax
This section is a work in progress. I don't have ETA for completion.

Congrats! You completed the basic part of the program. Program that teach you Chinese and Crystal Programming Language at the same time. You built a command line application that prints hello world and you learned how to say and write "hello world" in Chinese. This is your graduation party!

## What is my next step in the program?
