甜蜜蜜

tiánmì mì

As sweet as honey


你笑得甜蜜蜜

nǐ xiào dé tiánmì mì

your smile is so sweet as honey


好像花兒開在春風裡

hǎoxiàng huā er kāi zài chūnfēng lǐ

Just like flowers blooming with the spring winds


開在春風裡

kāi zài chūnfēng lǐ

Blooming with the spring winds

Where, oh where, have I seen you before


你的笑容這樣熟悉
