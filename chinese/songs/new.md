Rare gold, did I just find treasure
The way you move, I swear it's hard for me to measure
Right, left, can't nobody do it better
I can teach you baby, don't fold under pressure
不管在哪裡我都能 Follow
開始新的火焰 I'm spark it for ya
我們一起舞動搖擺 Salsa
Now we dancin' in euphoria

你知道 it's not a problem for me
All night all day
I love it when you go

Drop it low, can you do it on the floor, girl
Take control, girl, I know you see the goal, yeah
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom

不需要準備就能感受熱烈
Roll the dice now don't second guess it
給我這個夜晚你不能忘卻
不要停歇 Get it get it get it

All night, all day
