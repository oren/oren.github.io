<h2>Chinese Self-Study Resources</h2>
<h3>List 1: Vocabulary-centric options</h3>
<p>Duolingo: The classic gamified language learning app; Duolingo introduces basic vocabulary through games and translation. Grammar is introduced, but not explained very thoroughly.
Available online or as an app
Main features/courses are free</p>
<p>ChineseSkill: Similar to Duolingo, but specialized for Chinese learners. Has better grammar explanations than Duolingo, but is still gamified. Has several features that Duolingo does not have (tone drill, pinyin drill, character writing)
Available as an app only
Main features are free
HelloChinese: Similar to ChineseSkill. A gamified app similar to Duolingo, but specific to Chinese, and with more detail about grammar and culture. More features than Duolingo, but less than ChineseSkill.
Available as an app only
Main course is free, additional lessons cost money</p>
<p>Anki: Flashcards using a spaced repetition system (words show up again sooner if they are harder, later if they are easy). Very customizable, with a large range of premade flashcards, but a little difficult to get used to using.
Available online, as a download, or as an app
App version costs money, desktop version is free
Memrise: An online vocab learning site; uses gamification and sometimes provides user-created mnemonics (memory aids). Doesn’t help much with grammar, but it does have a range of courses available as you get more advanced.
Available online and as an app
Main features are free
Clozemaster: Clozemaster helps you learn vocabulary by giving you a real Chinese sentence with one word missing and making you choose the correct word from four options. The “Fluency Fast Track” will start with simple words and work up to harder ones. It does not explain grammar, but it will help you start to recognize grammar patterns and use context to figure out the correct word.
Available online and as an app
Completely free</p>
<p>Drops: A very visually appealing app to help learn vocabulary using pictures instead of English definitions. The free version is limited to five minutes of study per day, but it can be a good supplement to other tools.
Available as an app only (I think?)
Five minutes a day is free, more than that costs money</p>
<h3>List 2: Non-vocabulary centric options</h3>
<p>Chineasy: Originally a book, the Chineasy app teaches you basic characters by making them into drawings. The app also has features that help with tones, pronunciation, and simple sentences.
Good for: Characters, tones
Available as an app only
Most features free
HSK Reading: This is the website I got our recent dialogues from. It has a collection of dialogues ranging from beginner to advanced, with the ability to translate words by mousing over them. It also has simple comprehension questions.
Good for: Reading
Available online only
Free</p>
<p>U of Iowa Reading: The online resources includes short readings of all levels; each includes a pretest, reading comprehension questions, a posttest, and an audio recording. The dialogues may be a little advanced, so a dictionary app would be helpful.
Good for: Reading
Available online only
Free</p>
<p>Wordswing: Wordswing is mainly known for its text-based choose-your-own-adventure stories, which include word translation support. The app also has several SRS practice functions for learning characters, which might be more appropriate for your level.
Good for: Reading, character practice
Available online and as an app
Stories partially free, review features appear to be free</p>
<p>M Mandarin: This is an app that uses simple comics as a way to introduce vocabulary and grammar. It also includes grammar explanation, vocabulary review, and the option to record your own audio.
Good for: Reading, listening, speaking
Available as an app
Basic features appear to be free, there is a paid option</p>
<p>Chinese Grammar Wiki: This wiki includes a comprehensive list of grammar points with clear and simple example sentences, organized by level. Good for studying new grammar points and writing your own sentences.
Good for: Grammar, writing
Available online
Free</p>
<p>Youtubers: While native Chinese youtubers would be too hard to understand, Chinese language teaching channels can be more engaging for some learners. Learn specific vocabulary and grammar points, while practicing speaking and listening.
Good for: Speaking, listening
Available online
Free</p>
<p>Learning Chinese Through Stories: Similar to HSKreading, LCTS has a selection of texts of all levels, read slowly and clearly. The vocabulary is usually available online so you can look up unfamiliar words. They speak mostly in Chinese, so this is good for challenging yourself as you improve your Chinese.
Good for: Listening
Available online or on the podcast app
Free</p>
