<h1>Reduce conflicts at work</h1>

<p>Prepare a script for a difficult conversation at work.</p>

<ol>
<li>Think of a recent conflict with a co-worker. Enter their name.</li>
<li>What did they say or do?</li>
<li>How did you feel?</li>
<li>What do you need from them so you will feel better?</li>
<li>I am hearing that you want to feel [emotion] because [un-met need]. Is this accurate?</li>
<li>Would you like to have a conversation with them to make them aware of how you feel and what you need?</li>
<li>Here is my suggestion for your conversation with them: [observation], [feeling], [unmet need], [request]. Does this help you to be able to have a conversation with them?</li>
</ol>
