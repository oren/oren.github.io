## Westport

There is a specific area that is best for beginners: from the vertical log in the south to 200 feet from it. It's about 200 feet from the jetty. Let's call it the safe box.

The reason for introducing this concept is safety: there are to rips that will pull you to the outside. They are located at the south and north borders of the safe box.
