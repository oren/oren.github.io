<h2>How to kick</h2>

<p>You want to have small, faster kicks not large, slow kicks. Most people I’ve seen new to swimming start their kick from their knees, which is incorrect, try having your kick start from your core and quads/hamstrings. The only reason your knees bends is as a natural result of correct kicking.</p>

<p>You probably see a lot of experienced swimmers moving quickly with seemingly little effort, many probably barely kicking but still staying afloat. This kind of skill takes a lot of practice and that person has to understand their own buoyancy in the water.</p>

<p>Just be patient and stick with it, it will get easier.</p>

<p>Some drills that may be useful or just trying to deadman float on your stomach in the water. See what position makes your the most buoyant. Putting a kick board under your hips will help at first. Then once you can get floating down then put your arms together in a streamline, then your legs. Holding the line like this will help you understand your natural buoyancy</p>

<h2>How to breath</h2>

<p>Incorrect breathing will make it difficult to stay afloat because it moves your head out of alignment with your spine. Try taking smaller breaths, you don’t need to roll over into your back to get a breath. One quick turn of the head, breath in, return head. You also want to make sure you’re breathing at the correct time. I’ll use the right side breath as an example, when my left arm is extended in front of me I should be taking my breath. I should not begin pulling with my left arm until my head has returned to the correct position. Your right arm should be recovering over your head as this happens. This technique will help keep you afloat while breathing.</p>
