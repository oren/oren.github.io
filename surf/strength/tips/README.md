# Tips

* Identify rips and currents and decide on a safe zone for surfing
* Know the tide schedule (when is it high and when low)
* Be aware on the ground - is it sandy? rocky? Coral? Reef?
* Be aware of the depth of the water. It will determine the way you want to fall
* Attach the leg rope so the swivel sits on the outside of the ankel
* Keep distantce from other surfers
* Hold your board to your side and not your front
* Turn sideways when a wave comes - easier to move forward through the wave
* When falling in shallow water - step on the tail of the board or by holding the board in two hands
* Cover your head with both hands after you fall so your board or other boards won't hit your head

## Open Water Tips

* Learn to breath on both sides by breathing every third stroke. When the waves are beating you up you'll want flexibility.
* Take a good look at the conditions - Even a small swell can feel like "The Perfect Storm" when you are out rolling around in it. If you are asking yourself if it is safe to swim, it isn't. Just go back another day.
* Learn how to identify rips. People drown in oceans because they get stuck in a rip current, and begin to panic and waste energy trying to swim back to shore, when they just needed to swim a couple yards to the side.
* When you get in to the water, lie back and float for a few minutes - You will want to determine what direction the currents are pushing you.
* Don't swim underwater alone since you might blackout and nobody will see you. Surprisengly it's common among highly trained swimmers. [Reddit post about it from the point of view of a paramedic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/b1tfwr/dont_do_underwaters_alone).
