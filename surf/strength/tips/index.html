<h1>Tips</h1>

<ul>
<li>Identify rips and currents and decide on a safe zone for surfing</li>
<li>Know the tide schedule (when is it high and when low)</li>
<li>Be aware on the ground - is it sandy? rocky? Coral? Reef?</li>
<li>Be aware of the depth of the water. It will determine the way you want to fall</li>
<li>Attach the leg rope so the swivel sits on the outside of the ankel</li>
<li>Keep distantce from other surfers</li>
<li>Hold your board to your side and not your front</li>
<li>Turn sideways when a wave comes - easier to move forward through the wave</li>
<li>When falling in shallow water - step on the tail of the board or by holding the board in two hands</li>
<li>Cover your head with both hands after you fall so your board or other boards won&rsquo;t hit your head</li>
</ul>

<h2>Open Water Tips</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn to breath on both sides by breathing every third stroke. When the waves are beating you up you&rsquo;ll want flexibility.</li>
<li>Take a good look at the conditions - Even a small swell can feel like &ldquo;The Perfect Storm&rdquo; when you are out rolling around in it. If you are asking yourself if it is safe to swim, it isn&rsquo;t. Just go back another day.</li>
<li>Learn how to identify rips. People drown in oceans because they get stuck in a rip current, and begin to panic and waste energy trying to swim back to shore, when they just needed to swim a couple yards to the side.</li>
<li>When you get in to the water, lie back and float for a few minutes - You will want to determine what direction the currents are pushing you.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t swim underwater alone since you might blackout and nobody will see you. Surprisengly it&rsquo;s common among highly trained swimmers. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Swimming/comments/b1tfwr/dont_do_underwaters_alone">Reddit post about it from the point of view of a paramedic</a>.</li>
