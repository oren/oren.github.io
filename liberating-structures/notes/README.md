1. Ecocycle Planning - visualize your relationships on a maturity scale
1. Helping Heuristics - visualize the approach your friend help you (Quiet Presence, Guided Discovery, Loving Provocation, Process Mindfulness)
1. Appreciative interviews - provide example of someone that helped you. Which approach did they use?
